# Capsule Power-User Lab Guide

**Course:** Becoming a Capsule Power User
**Audience:** OXMIQ Student Interns (Reliability & Model Evaluation track)
**Duration:** 2 days (10 modules × ~45 min lecture + ~45 min lab)
**Prereqs:** Comfortable with a Unix shell, SSH, basic Python, and Git. No prior Capsule experience required.

---

## How to use this guide

Every module has the same shape:

1. **Concept** — what the feature is and why it exists.
2. **Demo** — commands the instructor will run live.
3. **Lab** — exercises you run yourself, with checkpoints.
4. **Stretch** — optional deeper exploration. Do these if you finish early or after class.
5. **Reliability lens** — what failure modes to watch for. This is the part that matters most for your internship.

Throughout, `<config-tag>` is a machine pool name (e.g. `gpu-workstation-01`) and `<unique-id>` is a specific machine (e.g. `boostergold461`). Run `capsule list` to see the pools you have access to; run `capsule list --all` to see unique IDs.

---

## Module 1 — Capsule Foundations

### Concept

Capsule is a remote development and application streaming platform. You stay on your laptop; the CPU, GPU, RAM, and disk live somewhere else. Everything you type — terminals, VS Code, Cursor, Claude Code, full desktops, ComfyUI — runs on remote hardware and is piped back to you over the network.

There are two connection paths underneath every command:

- **SshRTC data channel** (default). A WebRTC peer connection carries SSH traffic. The remote machine never needs a publicly reachable port. NAT traversal "just works" most of the time.
- **Direct SSH** (`--direct` flag). Normal TCP SSH. The remote must have a reachable SSH port. Faster and easier to debug; needed when WebRTC fails or when you want to use SSH features like port-forwarding cleanly.

Capsule is deployed across four **environments** and several **customer fleets**:

| Environment | B2C tenant                  | Typical use                  |
|-------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| `prod`      | `mihirainfra.b2clogin.com`  | Internal production fleet    |
| `public`    | `oxcapsule.b2clogin.com`    | External / partner access    |
| `dev`       | `mihirainfra.b2clogin.com`  | Development / testing        |
| `demo`      | `mihirainfra.b2clogin.com`  | Demos                        |

Customer fleets inside an environment: `micc` (default), `modelhosting`, `oneplay`, `cree8`.

Two facts worth memorising right now, because every confused support ticket eventually traces back to one of them:

1. **`public` and the others use different B2C tenants.** Your account in `prod` is not your account in `public`. Switching environments is followed by re-authenticating.
2. **Customer changes the fleet you see.** If `capsule list` looks empty or wrong, the first thing to check is `capsule config customer show`.

### Demo (instructor)

```bash
capsule --version
capsule env show
capsule config customer show
capsule list | head
```

### Lab

No tools to install yet. On paper or in your notes:

1. Explain SshRTC vs Direct SSH to your bench partner in your own words. What's the trade-off?
2. You see machines in `capsule list` that don't look like the production fleet. Name the two settings you'd inspect first.
3. A teammate emails you a unique ID `boostergold461`. What command lists machines so you can confirm that ID exists?

**Checkpoint:** You can explain to a non-Capsule engineer what the platform does in two sentences, and you know the names of the two routing dimensions (environment, customer).

### Reliability lens

Most "Capsule is broken" reports are really one of: (a) wrong environment, (b) wrong customer, (c) expired token, (d) SshRTC negotiating against a hostile network. Internalising those four candidates is half the job.

---

## Module 2 — Installation & First Login

### Concept

Install methods are OS-specific but the moving parts are the same: a CLI binary on your PATH, a GitHub PAT to fetch releases, `rclone` for cloud storage, and a one-time browser login that mints a Capsule auth token.

The PAT (`GH_TOKEN`) needs scopes `repo`, `read:org`, `workflow`, `user`. The token is used during installation and updates only — not at runtime.

### Demo

```bash
# macOS
export HOMEBREW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN=$GH_TOKEN
brew tap mihira-ai/software-packages https://$GH_TOKEN@github.com/mihira-ai/software-packages.git
brew install capsule

# Verify
capsule --version
capsule auth login
capsule status
```

### Lab

1. Install Capsule on your laptop using the instructions for your OS.
   - macOS: Homebrew tap + `brew install capsule`.
   - Windows: PowerShell as Administrator, `winget install --id GitHub.cli`, then download via `gh release download`. Don't forget `winget install Rclone.Rclone`.
   - Linux: install `gh`, then `gh release download -R mihira-ai/ox.capsule`.
2. Run `capsule --version`. Note the version on a sticky note — you'll need it when filing bugs.
3. Run `capsule auth login`. Complete the browser flow.
4. Run `capsule status`. Confirm your user name, display name, and token expiry.
5. Run `capsule auth storage` and complete the OneDrive consent flow.

**Checkpoint:** `capsule status` shows your identity and a non-empty expiry. You can list at least one machine: `capsule list | head`.

### Stretch

- Set `CAPSULE_AUTH_TOKEN` from a fresh login and run a command in a shell that has no browser session. This is how headless CI uses Capsule.
- Read the install scripts in this guide and identify, line by line, where rclone gets installed and why.

### Reliability lens

When a colleague says "install is broken", ask in this order: (1) Is `GH_TOKEN` set? (2) Do the token scopes match? (3) For macOS, is `HOMEBREW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN` exported in the *same* shell that's running `brew`? (4) For Windows, was the PowerShell restarted after the system env var was set?

---

## Module 3 — Environments, Customers, and Why Your Fleet Looks Wrong

### Concept

`capsule env set <name>` switches the backend endpoint and B2C tenant. `capsule config customer set <name>` switches which customer's fleet you're indexing into. Both persist across sessions. The auth token is **scoped to an environment**, so switching env requires a fresh `capsule auth login`.

### Demo

```bash
capsule env show
capsule env set public
capsule auth login              # required after env switch
capsule list
capsule config customer set modelhosting
capsule list
capsule config customer unset   # back to env default
capsule env set prod
capsule auth login
```

### Lab

1. Switch from your default environment to `public`, re-authenticate, and run `capsule list`. Note how the fleet changed.
2. Switch back to `prod` (or whichever is your primary). Re-auth. Verify with `capsule status`.
3. Set the customer to `modelhosting` and `capsule list` again. Observe which machines appear or disappear. Then `capsule config customer unset`.

**Checkpoint:** You can move between two environments and two customer overrides without help, and you can predict which fleet you'll see before running `capsule list`.

### Reliability lens

A common silent failure: a user reports "machine X disappeared". Nine times out of ten they accidentally switched customers (or someone wrote a setup script that did). `capsule config customer show` is always the first command in that conversation.

---

## Module 4 — The Fleet: Listing & Filtering Machines

### Concept

`capsule list` groups available machines by **config tag** (machine pool / class). When you ask for a config tag, the scheduler hands you any available machine from that pool. When you need a specific physical box, use `--all` to see **unique IDs** and target with `-u`/`--unique`.

Filters use a `key=value` (or `key>=value`) comma-separated grammar with AND semantics.

### Demo

```bash
capsule list
capsule list --all
capsule list --users
capsule list --json | jq '.[0]'

capsule list --filter "vendor=nvidia"
capsule list --filter "gpu=rtx"
capsule list --filter "os=linux"
capsule list --filter "vram>=24"
capsule list --filter "ci=true"
capsule list --filter "vendor=nvidia,vram>=24,memory>=100"
```

### Lab

1. List every NVIDIA machine with at least 24 GB of VRAM.
2. List every Tenstorrent machine. Note any that are CI-flagged.
3. Pipe `--json` into `jq` and count machines by vendor.
4. On Windows only: try the same filter using `cap` and notice when `>` fails in PowerShell. Switch to `capsule` and quote the argument.

**Checkpoint:** You can construct any filter expression on the fly and explain why `cap` shorthand breaks in PowerShell with `>` (PowerShell interprets it as redirection).

### Stretch

Write a small script (Python, Bash, your call) that consumes `capsule list --json` and prints a leaderboard of the top 5 machines by free VRAM. This kind of tooling is exactly what reliability work looks like.

### Reliability lens

`capsule list --users` is your fastest sniff test before scheduling expensive work — never blow away someone else's session by claiming a machine that already has an active user.

---

## Module 5 — Connecting to Machines

### Concept

There are five commands that all open some form of session on a remote machine:

| Command          | What it opens                       |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `capsule term`   | A shell (SSH over WebRTC by default)|
| `capsule exec`   | One-off remote command, then exit   |
| `capsule code`   | VS Code with Remote-SSH attached    |
| `capsule cursor` | Cursor with Remote-SSH attached     |
| `capsule claude` | Claude Code Desktop on the remote   |

All five accept the same routing flags:
- positional `<config-tag>` for any-from-pool, or `-u <unique-id>` for a specific box;
- `--direct` to bypass WebRTC and go straight to TCP SSH;
- `--idle-timeout` and `--max-session-length` to bound the session;
- `--turn` for an explicit TURN relay when peer-to-peer fails.

`capsule code` and `capsule cursor` also accept `--repo owner/repository` to clone a repo at session start. `capsule claude` does not.

### Demo

```bash
capsule term <config-tag>
capsule term -u <unique-id> --idle-timeout 2h --max-session-length 8h
capsule term <config-tag> -e "nvidia-smi"
capsule term <config-tag> --direct
capsule term <config-tag> --direct --options "-L 3000:localhost:3000"

capsule exec <config-tag> "df -h"
capsule code <config-tag> --repo mihira-ai/your-experiment
capsule claude <config-tag>
```

### Lab

1. Open a terminal on any NVIDIA machine with `capsule term`. Run `nvidia-smi` and `whoami`.
2. Run the same `nvidia-smi` non-interactively with `capsule exec <tag> "nvidia-smi"`.
3. Open VS Code on the same machine with `capsule code <tag>`. Confirm the integrated terminal is on the remote.
4. Open VS Code again, this time with `--direct`. Compare the connection latency informally.
5. Re-open the terminal session with `--idle-timeout 30m --max-session-length 1h`. Note the message describing the limits.

**Checkpoint:** You can choose between `term`, `exec`, `code`, and `claude` for a given workflow and justify the choice.

### Stretch

- Run `capsule term <tag> --direct --options "-L 9090:localhost:9090"` and start `python -m http.server 9090` on the remote. Visit `http://localhost:9090` locally. Convince yourself why `--direct` makes port-forwarding tractable.
- Read the `--turn` flag docs. When would you supply a custom TURN server, and what does that imply about your network?

### Reliability lens

Three rules:

1. If SshRTC negotiation fails, retry once after `capsule cleanup`. If it fails again, fall through to `--direct` and report the original failure with logs.
2. Always supply `--idle-timeout` and `--max-session-length` for batch-like work (benchmarks, long evals). Otherwise an idle terminal can pin a GPU for hours.
3. Don't leave stale `capsule-<uniqueId>` entries in your local `~/.ssh/config`. They cause cryptic Remote-SSH failures in VS Code.

---

## Module 6 — Files, Storage, and the OneDrive Mount

### Concept

Three orthogonal ways to move bytes between your laptop and a remote box:

1. **Auto-mounted OneDrive (`~/OneDrive`)** — fastest path for files you want to share across multiple machines. Set up once with `capsule auth storage`; every subsequent `capsule term`/`code`/`cursor`/`claude`/`stream` auto-mounts your `OxCapsule` OneDrive folder.
2. **SCP** — for one-off transfers, especially large blobs. `capsule scp upload` and `capsule scp download` understand both `<config-tag>` (any pool member) and `-u <unique-id>` (specific box). Add `--direct` if SshRTC is misbehaving.
3. **File passthrough** — small dotfiles you want copied at session start (`.vimrc`, `.gitconfig`). Configured locally with `capsule config files add`.

### Demo

```bash
capsule auth storage           # one-time OneDrive OAuth

capsule term <tag>
# Inside the session:
ls ~/OneDrive
cp model.safetensors ~/OneDrive/

# From your laptop:
capsule scp upload <tag> ./data/ /workspace/data/
capsule scp download <tag> /workspace/output/results.csv ./results/

capsule config files add .gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
capsule config files list
capsule config storage-mount-dir set /workspace/cloud
```

### Lab

1. Run `capsule auth storage` if you haven't yet. Connect to any machine and verify `ls ~/OneDrive` shows your `OxCapsule` folder.
2. Drop a `hello.txt` into `~/OneDrive` from machine A. Disconnect, connect to machine B, confirm the file is there.
3. Upload a small dataset to a remote machine with `capsule scp upload`. Then download a file back.
4. Add your `.gitconfig` to the file passthrough list. Reconnect and confirm `git config --global --list` reads it on the remote.
5. Override the storage mount to `/workspace/cloud` and reconnect. Confirm the mount moved. Then `unset` it.

**Checkpoint:** You know when to reach for each of the three transfer mechanisms, and you understand that the OneDrive mount is the same folder no matter which machine you're on.

### Reliability lens

If `~/OneDrive` is empty on the remote, the daemon couldn't mount it. Common causes: `rclone` missing locally, expired OneDrive OAuth, or VFS cache fighting with a previous session. Recovery: `capsule auth storage` again, then reconnect.

---

## Module 7 — Streaming & Containers

### Concept

`capsule stream <config-tag>` opens a hardware-encoded WebRTC stream of the remote desktop (or a single app with `--app <name>`). Use it for ComfyUI, Blender, browser-based debugging on the remote, or any GUI work. Hardware encoders used: NVENC (NVIDIA), VAAPI (Intel/AMD on Linux), VideoToolbox (Apple Silicon).

`capsule docker <config-tag>` launches a container on the remote and drops you into it. The defaults are `ubuntu:latest` with `bash`. Use `--image`, `--memory`, `--command`, `--volume`, and `-- <docker-args>` for everything else.

### Demo

```bash
capsule stream <config-tag>
capsule stream <config-tag> --app "blender"

capsule docker <config-tag> --image pytorch/pytorch:latest --memory 16
capsule docker <config-tag> --image nvidia/cuda:12.0-devel \
    --command "python train.py" \
    --volume "/data:/data:ro;/workspace:/workspace"
capsule docker <config-tag> -- --gpus all
```

### Lab

1. Stream a remote desktop. Verify clipboard sync by copying text both directions.
2. Stop the stream, then `capsule stream <tag> --app firefox` (or any app installed on the remote).
3. Launch an Ubuntu container on a remote machine. Inside, `nvidia-smi` should fail (no GPU exposed).
4. Re-launch with `-- --gpus all` and confirm `nvidia-smi` now sees the GPU.

**Checkpoint:** You can pick between `stream` (GUI) and `term` (CLI) based on the task, and you can expose a GPU into a container.

### Reliability lens

WebRTC streaming is bandwidth-sensitive. On a flaky network the first thing to drop is the video bitrate, then audio, then input. If users report "input lag", confirm their downlink with a separate speed test before assuming the encoder is at fault.

---

## Module 8 — Model Evaluation: Benchmarking (the InferenceMAX path)

> This is the most important module for the reliability & model evaluation track. Spend extra time here.

### Concept

`capsule benchmark <config-tag> <model>` provisions an inference server on the remote and drives it with InferenceMAX. The output is throughput, latency percentiles, and cost-per-token metrics, all uploaded to the Capsule benchmark dashboard unless you pass `--no-upload`.

Four backends are supported, each with different sweet spots:

| Backend     | When to choose it                                                |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `vllm`      | Default. Best for NVIDIA, batched serving, paged-attention.      |
| `llamacpp`  | CPU-friendly, GGUF quantizations (`Q4_K_M`, `Q5_K_M`).            |
| `mlx`       | Apple Silicon.                                                   |
| `oxpython`  | OXMIQ Python runtime; use for in-house evaluation paths.         |

Key knobs and what they mean:

- `--concurrency` (`-c`): max-num-seqs. How many requests the server batches at once.
- `--input-length` / `--isl`: tokens per prompt.
- `--output-length` / `--osl`: tokens generated per response.
- `--num-prompts` (`-n`): total requests sent. Defaults to `concurrency × 10`.
- `--tensor-parallelism` / `--tp`: split the model across N GPUs.
- `--quant` / `-q`: quantization scheme (`awq`, `gptq`, `fp8`, `int8`, `Q4_K_M`, `Q5_K_M`).
- `--api-base` + `--api-key`: skip provisioning entirely and benchmark an OpenAI-compatible endpoint you already have.

### Demo

```bash
# Default vllm bench on an NVIDIA machine
capsule benchmark <tag> meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct

# Realistic eval workload
capsule benchmark <tag> meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct \
    --concurrency 8 --input-length 256 --output-length 256 --num-prompts 40

# Quantized model on llamacpp
capsule benchmark <tag> Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GGUF \
    --backend llamacpp --quant Q4_K_M

# Multi-GPU tensor parallel
capsule benchmark <tag> meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct --tp 4

# Against an external endpoint, no machine deploy
capsule benchmark --api-base http://localhost:8000 --api-key test meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct

# Long run, suppress upload while iterating
capsule benchmark <tag> <model> --idle-timeout 4h --max-session-length 8h --no-upload
```

### Lab

1. Run a default benchmark on an 8B model on an NVIDIA box. Note the throughput in tokens/sec.
2. Re-run with `--concurrency 16` and `--num-prompts 160`. Compare throughput and latency.
3. Run the same model with `--quant awq`. Compare quality (eyeball a chat output) and throughput.
4. Run on a multi-GPU machine with `--tp 2`. Confirm the server actually used both GPUs (peek at `nvidia-smi` during the run from a second terminal).
5. Open the dashboard at `https://oxcapsulebenchmark.z22.web.core.windows.net` and find your runs.

**Checkpoint:** Given a hardware target and a model, you can pick a backend, set `tp` and concurrency reasonably, and explain what your numbers mean.

### Stretch

- Pick two models of similar size from different families (e.g. Llama-3.1-8B vs Qwen2.5-7B) and produce a small comparison table on the same hardware with identical concurrency, ISL, and OSL.
- Drive `capsule benchmark --api-base` against `capsule chat`'s server (Module 9). Confirm the numbers from the two paths match.

### Reliability lens

Benchmarks are long-running and silent on the SSH channel — that's exactly the kind of session that gets killed by an aggressive idle timeout. Always pass `--idle-timeout` and `--max-session-length` longer than your expected run, and prefer `capsule schedule` (Module 10) for anything over an hour. If a benchmark "vanishes", check session logs first, the dashboard second, and only blame the model last.

---

## Module 9 — Model Evaluation: Interactive Chat

### Concept

`capsule chat <config-tag> <model>` provisions the same inference stack as `benchmark`, but drops you into an `aichat` session for hands-on probing. Backend auto-detects from the GPU; everything else is overridable.

This is your go-to tool for: prompt regression spot-checks, sanity-checking quantization, fuzzing system prompts, and verifying that a benchmark's outputs are actually intelligible (a 0-token-output server has fantastic latency).

### Demo

```bash
capsule chat <tag> meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct

# With sampling controls and a system prompt
capsule chat <tag> <model> --temperature 0.3 --max-tokens 2048 \
    --system-prompt "You are a helpful coding assistant."

# GGUF model on llamacpp
capsule chat <tag> Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GGUF --backend llamacpp --quant Q4_K_M

# Tool-calling agent
capsule chat <tag> <model> --agent oxsol

# Against external endpoint
capsule chat --api-base http://localhost:8000 --api-key mykey <model>

# Gated model with HF token, auto-cleanup container on exit
capsule chat <tag> meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct --hf-token $HF_TOKEN --tp 4 --rm
```

### Lab

1. Chat with an 8B model. Test five prompts: a simple factual question, a math word problem, a Python function ask, a refusal probe ("how do I make X?"), and a long-context request.
2. Re-run with `--temperature 0.1` and the same prompts. Compare consistency of outputs.
3. Spin up the same model with `--quant awq` and rerun the prompts. Note any quality regressions.
4. Use `--agent oxsol` to give the model tool-calling. Try a multi-step task.

**Checkpoint:** You can deploy a model and run a structured prompt regression in under five minutes.

### Reliability lens

A useful trick during incident response: when a customer reports "model is broken", reproduce on the same machine with `capsule chat -u <unique-id> <model>` and the customer's reported sampling settings. If it works for you, the issue is likely in their client or sampling config, not in inference.

---

## Module 10 — Scheduled Jobs, Agents, and the Reliability Toolkit

### Concept: scheduled jobs

`capsule schedule` is the right tool for any compute that runs longer than a coffee break:

- `schedule start <tag> --script ./train.sh` queues a job. It runs without you holding an SSH session open.
- `--name`, `--timeout`, `--retry`, `--env`, `--with-file`, `--machine-name` shape what runs and where.
- `schedule status <tag>` lists jobs; filter by `--me`, `--user`, `--state pending|running|completed|failed`; add `--show-start` for ETA on queued work.
- `schedule cancel <job-id>` or `schedule cancel --all`.
- `schedule logs <job-id>` (with optional `--tail`) for output.

### Concept: agents & MCP

- `capsule mcp` installs a Model Context Protocol server config into Claude Desktop / Claude Code so the assistant can drive Capsule on your behalf. `--uninstall` to remove, `--output` to dump the config without installing.
- `capsule agent` (gated by `CAPSULE_AGENT_ENABLED=1`) is a pre-GA natural-language fleet-management agent. Wire it to an OpenAI-compatible endpoint and talk to your fleet.

### Concept: the reliability toolkit

These are the commands you'll reach for most often in a triage session:

```bash
capsule status                    # auth, identity, expiry
capsule env show                  # current environment
capsule config customer show      # current customer fleet
capsule cleanup                   # tear down stale WebRTC + SSH state
capsule --version                 # exact CLI build for bug reports
capsule --no-banner list          # clean output for logs / pasting in tickets
```

And the known-quirks list every intern should memorise:

| Symptom                                  | Fix                                                                          |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Auth fails in browser flow               | The CLI falls back to a manual token at `https://oxmiq.ai/oxcapsule/auth`.   |
| `capsule list` shows wrong machines      | Check `env show` and `config customer show` before anything else.            |
| SshRTC won't connect                     | `capsule cleanup`, retry, then `--direct` as fallback. Capture logs.         |
| VS Code Remote-SSH errors after a session| Remove `capsule-<uniqueId>` blocks from `~/.ssh/config`.                     |
| macOS Keychain prompts every command     | Click "Always Allow" once.                                                   |
| Windows PowerShell filter with `>` fails | Use `capsule` (not `cap`) and quote the whole filter argument.               |
| `capsule update` fails                   | Auth token must be valid; close all SshRTC sessions before retrying.         |
| `gh release download` 401/403            | Re-check `GH_TOKEN` scopes (`repo`, `read:org`, `workflow`, `user`).         |

### Demo

```bash
capsule schedule start <tag> --script ./eval.sh --name "llama-eval-v3" --timeout 4h
capsule schedule status <tag> --me --state running
capsule schedule logs <job-id> --tail 100
capsule schedule cancel <job-id>

capsule mcp                       # install Capsule MCP for Claude
capsule mcp --output ./mcp.json   # inspect config without installing

capsule cleanup
capsule --version
```

### Lab

1. Write a tiny `eval.sh` that runs `capsule benchmark` against an external `--api-base` and prints the result. Submit it with `capsule schedule start`, then watch `schedule status` and `schedule logs --tail`.
2. Cancel the job you just submitted.
3. Run `capsule mcp --output ./mcp.json` and read the file. Identify, by name, which Capsule actions the MCP exposes to Claude.
4. Run `capsule cleanup`. Re-list machines. Confirm nothing visibly changed for you (`cleanup` is mostly cleanup of *state*, not visible fleet objects).
5. Reproduce one entry from the known-quirks table on purpose (e.g. set the wrong customer) and follow the recovery recipe.

**Checkpoint:** You can run, monitor, and cancel a scheduled job. You can navigate the troubleshooting table from memory.

### Stretch

- Configure `capsule agent` against a local OpenAI-compatible server (or a `capsule chat` deployment) and ask it questions about your fleet.
- File a (sandboxed) bug report against the project that includes: `capsule --version`, `env show`, `config customer show`, the exact failing command, and the relevant logs. This is the report format your team will love you for.

### Reliability lens

You are now equipped to be the first responder. The shape of a good triage:

1. Reproduce yourself. If you can't reproduce, you don't have a bug yet — you have an incident.
2. Capture `capsule --version`, `env show`, `config customer show`, the exact command, the timestamp, and the unique ID of the machine (`capsule list --all`).
3. Try `cleanup` then `--direct` before escalating.
4. Default to scheduled jobs for anything long-running. Don't tie up a GPU on an interactive session that no human will be looking at for hours.

## Capstone Lab — Bench-to-Dashboard Round Trip

Do this end-to-end without notes. Time yourself.

1. From a fresh shell, confirm your environment is `prod` and customer is `micc`.
2. Find any NVIDIA machine with at least 24 GB VRAM that nobody else is using.
3. Open VS Code on that machine via SshRTC. Confirm `nvidia-smi` from the integrated terminal.
4. From your laptop, upload a small `prompts.txt` file to `/workspace/` on that machine via SCP.
5. Run a benchmark on `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct` with concurrency 8, ISL 256, OSL 256. Note the throughput.
6. Re-run with `--quant awq`. Note the new throughput.
7. Open the benchmark dashboard and find both runs.
8. Schedule the same benchmark as a background job with a 1-hour timeout.
9. While the scheduled job runs, open `capsule chat` against the same model and verify a few prompts qualitatively.
10. After everything completes, run `capsule cleanup`. Run `capsule list --users` and confirm you are no longer holding the machine.

Target time: under 30 minutes once you've done it once. Reliability work is mostly muscle memory.

## Glossary

- **Config tag** — a machine pool/class name; the scheduler hands you any available machine in that pool.
- **Unique ID** — a specific physical machine; always requires `-u`/`--unique`.
- **SshRTC** — Capsule's WebRTC-based SSH data channel. Default connection method.
- **Direct SSH** — traditional TCP SSH (`--direct`). Useful as a fallback or for clean port-forwarding.
- **Environment** — backend deployment (`prod`, `public`, `dev`, `demo`). Determines B2C tenant and endpoint.
- **Customer** — fleet selector inside an environment (`micc`, `modelhosting`, `oneplay`, `cree8`).
- **InferenceMAX** — the benchmark suite invoked by `capsule benchmark`.
- **TURN** — a WebRTC relay used when peer-to-peer NAT traversal fails.
- **MCP** — Model Context Protocol; how Claude Desktop/Code talks to Capsule as a tool.

## Self-assessment

If, by the end of the course, all of the following are true, you've passed:

- You can install, authenticate, and produce a benchmark run on a fresh laptop in under 15 minutes.
- You can debug a "Capsule isn't working" report by walking through env, customer, auth, and connection-method as a checklist — out loud — without hesitating.
- You can write a `capsule schedule` job that wraps a non-trivial eval and recover its logs after the fact.
- You can explain to a new intern, in two minutes, the difference between a config tag and a unique ID, and the difference between SshRTC and Direct SSH.

Welcome to the team.

# Appendix A — Lab Extensions & Reliability Drills

The labs above teach you the happy path. This appendix teaches you the *unhappy* path — the situations you'll actually be paid to handle. Each section pairs an extension lab (more depth on a module's topic) with a reliability drill (a fault to inject and triage).

## How to use this appendix

- **Extension labs (E.x)**: deepen a single module. Budget ~30 min each.
- **Reliability drills (R.x)**: instructor-led fault injection; pairs work through the triage decision tree. Budget ~20 min each.
- **Mastery checklist** at the end: 9 items. Hit them all and you're calibrated.

## E.1 — Routing-matrix sweep (Modules 1, 3)

**Goal**: walk all 16 cells of the env × customer matrix and observe what each one returns.

1. Script a loop: for env in {prod, public, dev, demo}, for customer in {micc, modelhosting, oneplay, cree8}, call `capsule env set $env && capsule auth login && capsule config customer set $customer && capsule list | wc -l`.
2. Record the result count for each cell in a 4×4 table.
3. Identify the **3 cells** where you have access. Note which envs require a separate re-auth.
4. Submit the table to your instructor.

**Expected outcome**: ~3-5 cells populated for an intern; everywhere else returns empty or 403.

## E.2 — Install on a stranger's laptop (Module 2)

**Goal**: prove you can hit the 15-minute install bar on hardware you don't control.

1. Pair with another intern. Use *their* laptop, not yours.
2. Start a stopwatch.
3. Install from scratch: brew/dpkg/msi → tap → bottle → login → `capsule list` returning a real fleet.
4. Stop the stopwatch.
5. Record the elapsed time and any obstacles (corporate proxy, DNS, missing CLI tools).

**Target**: <15 min. **Outcome**: if you exceed 20 min, write a one-paragraph postmortem on what slowed you down.

## E.3 — Filter speed-run (Module 4)

**Goal**: build muscle memory for fleet filtering.

1. For each of these targets, write the *single* `capsule list` command that returns it:
   - All H100 machines with no active users.
   - All Tenstorrent Blackhole machines.
   - All Apple Silicon machines.
   - A specific known unique ID.
   - Any GPU with ≥40 GB VRAM.
2. Time yourself. Target: <10 sec per command including typing.

## E.4 — Five verbs on one box (Module 5)

**Goal**: feel the difference between the connection verbs.

1. Pick a single unique ID. Open it 5 ways in 5 terminal panes:
   - `capsule term -u <id>`
   - `capsule exec -u <id> -- htop`
   - `capsule code -u <id>`
   - `capsule cursor -u <id>`
   - `capsule claude -u <id>`
2. Time each attach. Compare against the targets (term <1s, exec <0.5s, code ~3s, cursor ~3s, claude ~2s).
3. In each surface, run `nvidia-smi`. Note the user experience differences.

## E.5 — Storage scope experiment (Module 6)

**Goal**: internalize the 3-scope durability model.

1. On a single machine, write the same 100MB file to `/tmp/test.bin`, `~/test.bin`, and `~/OneDrive/test.bin`.
2. Time each write. Record the throughput.
3. Restart the container (or `capsule cleanup` and reconnect).
4. Confirm `/tmp/test.bin` is gone; `~/test.bin` survives; `~/OneDrive/test.bin` is also visible from a *second* machine.
5. Delete `~/OneDrive/test.bin` from machine A; confirm it disappears from machine B within ~60 sec.

**Outcome**: a one-paragraph rule for "where do my outputs go?" that you can recite.

## E.6 — Benchmark variance study (Module 8)

**Goal**: see why one number is not a measurement.

1. Pick a single H100 unique ID. Run `capsule benchmark --model llama3.1-8b --config nv-h100` **5 times back-to-back**.
2. Record decode tok/sec for each run.
3. Compute median, p95, and (max − min) / median.
4. If variance is >10%, identify the cause: thermal warm-up, noisy neighbor, or measurement artifact.
5. Add a 60-second warm-up before each run; repeat. Does variance drop?

**Target**: <5% variance with proper warm-up. **Outcome**: a one-line "how I report a benchmark number" rule.

## E.7 — Schedule + recover (Module 10)

**Goal**: prove you can lose nothing on a long job.

1. Write a `sweep.sh` that runs 4 benchmarks taking ~10 min each.
2. Submit it with `capsule schedule start --script ./sweep.sh --config nv-h100 --timeout 1h`.
3. Note the job ID. **Close your laptop.** Walk away for 45 min.
4. Reopen. Find the job. Pull its logs.
5. Verify the outputs landed in OneDrive (not just persistent volume).

**Outcome**: a job you can hand off to a teammate without loss.

## R.1 — Empty list triage (Module 3)

Instructor sets a student's env+customer to a cell they don't have access to. Student must:
- Recognize the empty list.
- Walk the triage tree out loud (env? customer? auth?).
- Resolve in <2 min.

## R.2 — Token expiry mid-session (Module 2)

Instructor lets a student work normally for 60+ min, then has them run a command. They get 401/403. Student must:
- Recognize the auth failure (not a fleet failure).
- Re-authenticate.
- Resume without re-doing prior work.

## R.3 — SshRTC stall (Module 5)

Instructor simulates a degraded WebRTC connection (or asks student to work over hotspot). Student must:
- Notice keystroke echo >80ms.
- Fall back to `--direct`.
- Confirm responsiveness improves.
- File the WebRTC peer issue (don't just work around it).

## R.4 — Disappeared data (Module 6)

Instructor has student write benchmark output to `/tmp`, then cleanup. Student reports "data disappeared." Student must:
- Identify the scope (ephemeral).
- Explain why it's gone.
- Re-run with a durable scope.

## R.5 — Thermal-throttled benchmark (Module 8)

Instructor preloads a machine with a heavy workload, then has student benchmark on it. Student must:
- See decode tok/sec well below the 1500-2500 band.
- Check `nvidia-smi -q -d TEMPERATURE`.
- Diagnose throttle vs. driver vs. PCIe.
- Either wait or pick a different machine.

## R.6 — Forgotten --parallel (Module 10)

Instructor has student submit an 8-model sweep without `--parallel`. After 30 min, student checks ETA: it's 5.5 hours, not 90 min. Student must:
- Kill the job.
- Resubmit with `--parallel 4`.
- Compute the cost difference and report it.

Self-grade after the labs and drills. You're calibrated when **all 9** are true:

- [ ] I can name and recite the 16 routing cells without hesitation.
- [ ] I can install Capsule on a fresh laptop in <15 min.
- [ ] I can write the right `capsule list` filter for any hardware class in <10 sec.
- [ ] I can pick the right connection verb in <5 sec for any task.
- [ ] I can predict whether a given file path is ephemeral, persistent, or synced.
- [ ] I have run >=3 benchmarks and reported median + p95.
- [ ] I have scheduled, walked away, and recovered logs from a multi-hour job.
- [ ] I can walk the triage decision tree from memory.
- [ ] I can compute the cost of a sweep at $2/H100-hour and the savings from `--parallel`.

If any are false, return to the matching module's lab and the matching drill.
