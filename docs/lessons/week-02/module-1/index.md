## Part 1 — Pre-Reading Review · 15 min
### Before You Start

You should have already read: Inference Engineering Pre-Lecture Reading — **Reader 1 (AI in production)** (~15 min).

### Quick Self-Check

Answer these questions from memory:
1. What's more expensive long-term: training or inference? Why?
2. What's the difference between a closed model and an open model? Name one of each.
3. What is a **token**?

If you couldn't answer all three, review the Pre-Lecture Reading again before proceeding.

### Readiness Check

Not gated; the score nudges you to re-read or to ask OxTutor before continuing.

      "Training is done by researchers; inference is done by users"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "Training modifies the model's weights through backpropagation. Inference is a forward pass only — the model reads its weights to generate predictions. This is the foundational difference that drives all inference optimization."

      "Inference requires more compute per token",

      "Training can be parallelized but inference cannot",
      "Inference models are always larger than training models"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "Training is a one-time cost (or periodic fine-tuning). Inference costs accumulate with every user query — millions of inferences over a model's lifetime often exceed the one-time training cost. This is why inference optimization matters."

    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "Tokenization converts raw text into tokens — typically subword units (like 'un+likely' from 'unlikely'). The model operates on tokens, not raw characters. This is the first step in the pipeline."

      "They store the conversation history"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "The layers (transformer blocks) process the embedded tokens through self-attention and feedforward networks. Each layer transforms the representations until the final layer outputs logits for token prediction."

    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "KV caching stores the key and value matrices from attention computations. When generating token-by-token, the KVs for previous tokens are cached so they don't need to be recomputed — this is critical for decode-stage efficiency."

## Part 2 — Core Concepts — Inference Pipeline · 20 min
### Reading — Why This Matters

Phase 1 (Weeks 2–5) is a four-week zoom-in on the **inference loop**. Before we open up the GPU (Day 7), the cache (Week 3), or the cluster (Week 4), you need a working mental model of what *actually happens* when a user hits send.

### The Inference Pipeline

```
text  →  [tokenize]  →  token IDs  →  [embed]  →  vectors  →
        [transformer layers × N]  →  hidden states  →
        [LM head]  →  logits  →  [sample]  →  next token
```

Then **loop** the layers→logits→sample steps. Each loop = one output token.

### Five Stages, In One Sentence Each

| Stage | What Happens | Input → Output |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| **1. Tokenize** | Text becomes integers (typically BPE-encoded, vocabulary 32K–200K) | "Hello world" → [1234, 5678] |
| **2. Embed** | Each token ID becomes a dense vector (the model's hidden size, e.g. 4096) | [1234] → [0.1, -0.3, 0.5, ...] |
| **3. Layers** | Vectors pass through N transformer blocks (attention + MLP), each refining the representation. *This is where the GPU spends its time.* | [vector] × 32-80 layers |
| **4. Logits** | The final hidden state is projected to a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary | [hidden state] → [0.001, 0.023, ...] |
| **5. Sample** | Pick one token (greedy, top-k, top-p, temperature). That's your next output. | [logits] → "Paris" |

## Part 3 — Deep Dive — Prefill vs Decode · 20 min
### Reading — Two Phases of Inference

### Prefill

- **What:** Run all your *input* tokens through the layers in one shot
- **How:** Parallel — all tokens processed simultaneously
- **What it does:** Computes the initial hidden states for each input token
- **Bottleneck:** Compute-bound (GPU is fully busy)
- **Drives:** **TTFT** (Time To First Token)

### Decode

- **What:** Generate output tokens one at a time
- **How:** Sequential — each token depends on all previous tokens
- **What it does:** Uses KV cache from prefill to predict the next token
- **Bottleneck:** Memory-bound (waiting for KV cache reads)
- **Drives:** **TPS** (Tokens Per Second)

### Key Insight

> **Prefill = compute-bound** (GPU is the bottleneck)
> **Decode = memory-bound** (KV cache reads are the bottleneck)

This distinction drives everything in Weeks 2-4.

## Part 4 — Worked Example Analysis · 25 min
### Reading — Timeline of a Chat Request

From the Pre-Lecture Reading:

> Suppose you ask "What is the capital of France?" Here is what's happening behind the scenes:

| Time | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| 0 ms | Your browser sends a request to the server |
| 30 ms | Request reaches load balancer, routed to data center |
| 40 ms | Backend assembles prompt (system + history + question) |
| 45 ms | Backend forwards input to inference server |
| **45-200 ms** | **Prefill** — process all input tokens at once |
| **200 ms** | **First token** ("Paris") is generated — TTFT |
| 200-300 ms | **Decode** — generate remaining tokens one at a time |
| 300 ms | Stop token emitted, response complete |

### Annotate the Timeline

1. **Where does TTFT live?** (Answer: 45-200 ms)
2. **Where does end-to-end latency live?** (Answer: 45-300 ms)
3. **What's happening in the 45-200 ms window?** (Answer: Prefill — compute-intensive)
4. **What's happening in the 200-300 ms window?** (Answer: Decode — memory-intensive)

## Part 5 — Hands-On — Trace the Pipeline · 30 min
### Exercise 1: Trace a Prompt (15 min)

On paper, trace a 5-word prompt through the pipeline. For each stage, annotate:
- Input shape
- Output shape
- What changed

**Example:**
```
Input: "What is AI?"

Tokenize: "What" → 1234, "is" → 567, "AI" → 8901, "?" → 42
Embed: [1234] → [0.1, -0.3, 0.5, ...] (4096 floats)
Layers: 32 layers of attention + MLP
Logits: [0.001, 0.023, ...] (vocabulary size, e.g., 50K)
Sample: "Artificial" (next token)
```

### Exercise 2: Calculate Forward Passes (15 min)

Given:
- 1000 input tokens
- 500 output tokens
- Model: 32 layers, hidden size 4096

**Calculate:**
1. How many total forward passes? (Answer: 1000 + 500 = 1500)
2. How many prefill passes? (Answer: 1000)
3. How many decode passes? (Answer: 500)

    ],
    "answer": 1,

      "The embedding step — how fast token IDs become vectors"
    ],
    "answer": 1,

    "answer": 1,

    ],
    "answer": 1,

### Connect Forward

Tomorrow: we crack open the GPU itself — SMs, Tensor Cores, HBM. Today's "layers spend GPU time" becomes tomorrow's "*here's exactly where in the chip that time goes*."

### Pre-read for tomorrow (Day 7 · Meet the GPU)

- **Resource:** <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-hopper-architecture/nvidia-tensor-core-gpu-datasheet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA H100 GPU Datasheet</a> (~10 min, focus on: SMs, memory capacity, bandwidth, peak FLOPS).
- **Reflection questions:**
  1. What does "80 GB HBM3" mean? (Memory technology + capacity.)
  2. What's an SM? What's a Tensor Core?
  3. Why is intra-GPU memory faster than GPU-to-GPU which is faster than node-to-node?
