    "options": [
      "Compute is free; bandwidth is expensive",

      "Compute cannot be parallelized effectively"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "Most deep learning operations (especially inference) are memory-bound. The GPU waits for data from HBM far more than it waits for compute units. This is why bandwidth — the rate at which data can be moved — often matters more than raw compute capacity."

    "stem": "In the GPU memory hierarchy, which is fastest and which is slowest?",
    "options": [
      "Registers fastest, HBM slowest",

    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "Registers are the fastest (sub-nanosecond), followed by L1/shared memory (~1ns), L2 cache (~5ns), and HBM (~80ns). Each level up is larger but slower — this is the memory hierarchy."

    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "Temporal locality means if you accessed data recently, you're likely to access it again soon. Caches exploit this — keep recently-used data close to the compute units. This is why KV cache matters for inference."
  },
  {
    "stem": "What is spatial locality?",
    "options": [
      "Accessing the same data repeatedly over time",
      "Accessing memory locations that are close together in address space",

    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "Spatial locality means if you accessed one memory location, you'll likely access nearby locations soon. This is why memory transfers happen in blocks/chunks, and why contiguous memory access is faster."

    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "Kernel fusion combines multiple operations (e.g., add + relu) into a single kernel. This eliminates intermediate reads/writes to HBM — data stays in registers/L1 between operations. Less data movement = faster."

    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "L2 cache access is ~5ns vs HBM at ~80ns — roughly 10-20x faster. This is why caching strategies (KV cache, FlashAttention) are so impactful: keeping data in cache avoids the slow HBM access."

## Part 2 — Core Concepts — Memory Hierarchy · 20 min
### Reading — The Single Most Important Insight

This is the single most important insight in the entire phase: **for LLM decode, the GPU is almost always waiting on HBM, not computing.** Once you see it, every Week 3–5 trick (KV cache, FlashAttention, quantization, paged attention) becomes "obvious" — they're all about moving less data.

### The Memory Hierarchy

```
fast ▲   Registers     <1 ns       KBs/core
       │   L1 / Shared    ~1 ns       256 KB/SM
       │   L2             ~5 ns       50 MB chip-wide
       │   HBM3           ~80 ns      80 GB @ 3.35 TB/s
slow ▼   PCIe / Net     µs–ms       unlimited
```

### Two Rules

1. **Fast memory is small.** You can't fit the model in L2.
2. **Bandwidth, not latency, dominates for large reads.** What matters is the *rate* at which data flows.

### Speed Comparison

| Memory | Approximate Speed | Relative to HBM |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Registers | <1 ns | ~100x faster |
| L1 / Shared | ~1 ns | ~80x faster |
| L2 | ~5 ns | ~16x faster |
| HBM | ~80 ns | baseline |
| PCIe | µs–ms | ~10-100x slower |

## Part 3 — Deep Dive — Arithmetic Intensity · 25 min
### Reading — Compute-Bound vs Memory-Bound

For a kernel that does `B` bytes of memory traffic and `F` FLOPs:

- **Arithmetic intensity** = `F / B` (ops per byte)
- **Hardware ridge point** for H100 FP16: ~989 TFLOPs ÷ 3.35 TB/s ≈ **295 ops/byte**

### The Decision Rule

| Condition | You Are... | GPU Status |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Intensity **above** ridge (~295) | Compute-bound | Limited by Tensor Cores |
| Intensity **below** ridge (~295) | Memory-bound | Limited by HBM bandwidth — Tensor Cores sitting idle |

### The Shocking Fact

> **Decode for one user = ~2 ops/byte. That is ~150× below the ridge. The GPU is idle ~99% of the time waiting on weights.**

This single fact explains why batching, KV cache, quantization, and continuous batching all exist.

## Part 4 — Worked Example Analysis · 20 min
### Reading — Read Time Calculation

> **Worked example:** Time to read 16 GB from HBM at 3.35 TB/s
>
> 16 GB ÷ 3.35 TB/s = 16 ÷ 3350 s ≈ **4.8 ms** just to *read* the data once.

If you had to do this for every output token of a 70B model loaded across 8 GPUs (so each GPU reads ~17 GB of weights per token), decode latency floor ≈ 4–5 ms/token — and that's *before* doing any actual math.

### Why Kernel Fusion Matters

- **Two unfused kernels:** each writes output to HBM (~80 ns + bandwidth cost), then the next reads it back
- **Fused into one kernel:** intermediates stay in registers (sub-ns)
- **Same math, ~75× faster** for a 4 KB block reused 1000 times

> **FlashAttention (tomorrow's day) is exactly this idea.**

## Part 5 — Hands-On — Calculate · 25 min
### Exercise 1: Read Time (10 min)

Calculate: time to read 16 GB from H100 HBM at 3.35 TB/s.

**Formula:** Time = Size / Bandwidth

**Answer:**
- 16 GB ÷ 3.35 TB/s = 16 ÷ 3,350 seconds = **4.8 ms**

Now calculate: time if you could keep it in L2 (assume L2 bandwidth ≈ 12 TB/s):

**Answer:**
- 16 GB ÷ 12 TB/s = 16 ÷ 12,000 seconds = **1.3 ms**

### Exercise 2: Arithmetic Intensity (15 min)

Calculate arithmetic intensity for:

**(a) Matrix multiply of two N×N matrices (N=4096)**
- FLOPs: ~2N³ = 2 × 4096³ = ~137 billion FLOPs
- Bytes: 3N² × 2 bytes (FP16) = ~100 MB
- Intensity: ~137B / 100M = ~1,371,000 ops/byte

**(b) Elementwise add of two N-vectors**
- FLOPs: N = 4096
- Bytes: 2N × 2 bytes = ~16 KB
- Intensity: 4096 / 16,384 = ~0.25 ops/byte

**Question:** Which is compute-bound, which is memory-bound?

**Answer:** (a) is compute-bound (way above ridge), (b) is memory-bound (way below ridge)

    "explain": "The ridge point for H100 is ~295 ops/byte (989 TFLOPs ÷ 3.35 TB/s). Any kernel performing fewer than ~295 operations per byte of memory transferred is memory-bound and won't fully utilize the Tensor Cores."
  },
  {
    "stem": "Why is LLM decode roughly 150× below the H100 ridge point?",
    "options": [
      "Decode uses low-precision integers which reduce arithmetic intensity",
      "Decode processes one token at a time, requiring a full model weight read for very little compute — roughly 2 ops/byte",

      "Decode requires double-precision arithmetic which is 150× slower than FP16"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "During decode, each step reads all model weights (~2 bytes/param for FP16) to perform ~2 multiply-add operations per parameter. That's ~2 ops/byte vs the ridge point of ~295 ops/byte — roughly 150× below the compute-optimal ratio. The GPU is almost entirely idle waiting for memory."

  {
    "stem": "What does kernel fusion do to improve performance?",

    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "Kernel fusion combines multiple sequential operations (e.g., layernorm + attention + activation) into a single GPU kernel. Instead of reading from and writing to HBM between each operation, intermediate results stay in L1/registers. This increases effective arithmetic intensity and reduces memory bandwidth usage."

      "HBM pages recently evicted can be immediately re-used without penalty"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "Temporal locality means recently used data is likely to be used again soon. GPUs exploit this via L2 and L1 caches — if weights or KV cache entries are reused within a short window, they may be served from cache rather than from HBM, significantly reducing bandwidth pressure."
  },
  {
    "stem": "If a kernel does 600 GFLOP and transfers 4 GB of data, and the H100 ridge point is 295 ops/byte, is this kernel compute-bound or memory-bound?",

      "Compute-bound — it does more than the ridge point",
      "Memory-bound — it does fewer than the ridge point",
      "Cannot be determined without knowing the clock speed",
      "Balanced — it is exactly at the ridge point"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "Arithmetic intensity = 600 GFLOP ÷ 4 GB = 150 ops/byte. Wait — 150 < 295, so this is actually memory-bound. But the question says 600 GFLOP / 4 GB: let me recalculate: 600×10^9 / (4×10^9) = 150 ops/byte < 295 → memory-bound. A kernel is compute-bound only if its intensity exceeds the ridge point (~295 ops/byte for H100)."

### Connect Forward

Tomorrow: arithmetic intensity gets formalized into the **roofline model**, and we classify five real workloads against it.

### Pre-read for tomorrow (Day 9 · Compute-Bound vs Memory-Bound)

- **Resource:** <a href="https://horace.io/brrr_intro.html#compute" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horace He — Making Deep Learning Go Brrr (Compute section)</a> (~15 min, read the arithmetic intensity section).
- **Reflection questions:**
  1. If a kernel does 100 ops and reads 50 bytes, what's its intensity?
  2. Why is prefill compute-bound and decode memory-bound? (One sentence.)
  3. What does the *roofline model* tell you that arithmetic intensity alone doesn't?
