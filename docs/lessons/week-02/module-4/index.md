## Part 1 — Pre-Reading Review · 10 min
### Before You Start

You should have already read: Pre-Lecture Reading **Reader 4 (complexity, memory, attention math)** + Study Guide §A.5 roofline subsection (~15 min).

### Quick Self-Check

Answer these questions from memory:
1. If a kernel does 100 ops and reads 50 bytes, what's its intensity?
2. Why is prefill compute-bound and decode memory-bound? (One sentence.)
3. What does the *roofline model* tell you that arithmetic intensity alone doesn't?

### Readiness Check

Not gated; the score nudges you to re-read or to ask OxTutor before continuing.

    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "Decode generates one token at a time. The compute per new token is small (one token's attention), but you still need to read the full KV cache from HBM. Low ops:byte ratio = memory-bound, waiting on HBM."

## Part 2 — Core Concepts — Roofline Model · 25 min
### Reading — Why the Roofline Matters

Knowing *which ceiling* a workload hits tells you *which knob to turn*: more FLOPs (bigger / better Tensor Cores)? more bandwidth (HBM3e, NVLink)? more parallelism? You can't optimize what you can't classify.

### The Roofline Model

The roofline is a single plot that tells you the **maximum achievable performance** for a given workload on given hardware.

```
performance (FLOP/s)
   ▲
   │           ╭───── compute ceiling (peak TFLOPs)
   │          ╱
   │         ╱
   │        ╱
   │       ╱
   │      ╱       ← BW × intensity slope
   │     ╱
   │    ╱
   │   ╱
   ├──┴─────────────────────► arithmetic intensity (ops/byte)
       ridge point
       (peak FLOPs ÷ BW)
```

### How to Use the Roofline

For each kernel:

1. **Plot it horizontally** at its intensity (ops/byte)
2. **Plot it vertically** at its measured FLOP/s
3. The line above it is the ceiling:
   - Left of ridge: bandwidth-slope
   - Right of ridge: compute-ceiling

## Part 3 — Deep Dive — Ridge Points · 15 min
### Reading — Ridge Point Examples

### Ridge Point Formula

> **Ridge Point = Peak FLOPs ÷ Bandwidth**

### Examples (FP16)

| Hardware | Peak FLOPs | BW | Ridge ≈ |
|---|---|---|---|
| H100 SXM5 | 989 TFLOPs | 3.35 TB/s | ~295 ops/byte |
| RTX 4090 | 165 TFLOPs | 1 TB/s | ~165 ops/byte |
| Wormhole n150 | ~74 TFLOPs | ~270 GB/s | ~274 ops/byte |

### Key Insight

- **Above the ridge:** You're compute-bound (hitting the Tensor Cores)
- **Below the ridge:** You're memory-bound (hitting the HBM bandwidth)

## Part 4 — Deep Dive — Where Kernels Sit · 20 min
### Reading — Common Workloads

| Kernel | Intensity (rough) | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| GEMM, large square | ~N (thousands) | **Compute-bound** |
| Prefill attention (long input) | ~hundreds | **Compute-bound** |
| Decode attention (one token) | ~2–10 | **Memory-bound** |
| Decode MLP (one token, one user) | ~2 | **Memory-bound** |
| Elementwise add / scale | ~0.5 | **Bandwidth-bound** |
| All-reduce across nodes | ~0 | **Network-bound** |

### The Punchline

> **Prefill = compute-bound.** All input tokens are processed in parallel → big GEMMs → intensity is high → you're hitting the Tensor Cores.
>
> **Decode = memory-bound.** One token at a time → you re-read all weights per token → intensity is tiny → you're hitting the HBM ceiling.

### Why This Matters — Every Week 3-4 Trick

| Trick | Why It Helps |
|-------|--------------|
| **KV cache** | Don't re-compute past keys/values, just read them |
| **FlashAttention** | Fuse attention into one pass, minimize HBM reads |
| **Quantization** | Fewer bits per weight = less data to move = decode goes faster |
| **Continuous batching** | Pack many users' decodes so weights are re-used across them |
| **Speculative decoding** | Convert decode (memory-bound, 1 token) into a small prefill (compute-bound, K tokens) |

---

## Part 5 — Hands-On — Calculate · 25 min
### Exercise 1: Arithmetic Intensity (10 min)

Calculate arithmetic intensity for:

**(a) `y = a*x + b` over 1M elements**
- FLOPs: 2 ops per element × 1M = 2M FLOPs
- Bytes: 3 arrays × 1M × 2 bytes (FP16) = 6 MB
- Intensity: 2M / 6M = ~0.33 ops/byte

**(b) Matrix multiply 4096×4096 by 4096×4096 in FP16**
- FLOPs: 2N³ = 2 × 4096³ = ~137B FLOPs
- Bytes: 3N² × 2 = ~100 MB
- Intensity: ~1,371,000 ops/byte

### Exercise 2: Tensor Core Utilization (15 min)

At intensity = 2 ops/byte (decode), what fraction of H100's peak compute can you actually use?

**Calculation:**
- Ridge = ~295 ops/byte
- Your intensity = 2 ops/byte
- Fraction = 2 / 295 ≈ **0.68%**

**Answer:** Only ~0.7% of the Tensor Cores are being used! The other 99.3% are idle, waiting for data.

**Implication:** This explains why batching exists — if you pack multiple decodes together, you reuse weights and increase your effective intensity.

    "explain": "The roofline model plots performance (FLOP/s) vs arithmetic intensity (ops/byte) and shows two ceilings: the memory bandwidth roof (below the ridge point) and the compute roof (above it). It tells you whether your kernel is bottlenecked by memory or compute — and by how much."
  },
  {
    "stem": "Where does LLM decode sit on the roofline, relative to the ridge point?",
    "options": [
      "Well above the ridge — it is heavily compute-bound",

      "Off the chart — the roofline does not apply to LLM workloads"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explain": "Decode reads model weights to perform ~2 multiplications per byte — roughly 150× below the H100 ridge point of ~295 ops/byte. It sits far to the left on the roofline plot, deep in the memory-bound region."

      "~10%",
      "~5%",
      "~0.7%"
    ],
    "answer": 3,
    "explain": "Part 5 calculates: decode intensity ≈ 2 ops/byte ÷ ridge point 295 ops/byte ≈ 0.68%. Only ~0.7% of the H100's Tensor Core compute capacity is used during decode — the other 99.3% sit idle waiting for HBM reads. This is why batching is so important."
  },
  {
    "stem": "Why does batching multiple decode requests together increase arithmetic intensity?",
    "options": [
      "Batching allows model weights to be split across multiple GPUs, reducing per-GPU memory pressure",

      "Batching enables the use of INT8 precision, which has higher ops/byte than FP16",
      "Batching reduces the KV cache size because requests share context"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "If a single decode reads W bytes of weights and does 2W operations, batching 8 requests reads W bytes once but performs 8×2W operations — intensity ×8. This is the fundamental reason batching improves GPU utilization for memory-bound workloads."
  },
  {
    "stem": "Where does LLM prefill sit on the roofline?",
    "options": [
      "Well below the ridge, even deeper into the memory-bound region than decode",

      "At the same point as decode since both use the same model weights",
      "Above all hardware limits — it exceeds both memory and compute ceilings"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "Prefill processes all input tokens simultaneously (a large matrix multiply), which achieves high arithmetic intensity. It sits at or above the ridge point — compute-bound. This is why prefill time scales with compute throughput (TFLOPs), while decode time scales with memory bandwidth."

      "Reducing vocabulary size and using a smaller tokenizer"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "Quantization reduces bytes transferred per parameter (e.g., FP16 → INT4 = 4× fewer bytes → 4× higher intensity). Batching amortizes weight reads across multiple requests (intensity scales with batch size). Both are covered in Weeks 3–4 of the curriculum."
