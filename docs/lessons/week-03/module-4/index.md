## Part 1 — Pre-Reading Review · 10 min
### Before You Start

You should have already read: "What is quantization?" — Pre-Lecture Reading **Reader 7** (~20 min).

### Quick Self-Check

Answer these questions from memory:
1. FP16 = ___ bytes. FP8 = ___. INT4 = ___.
2. Why does *float* (FP) have an advantage over *int* (INT) at the same bit count?
3. Which is more sensitive to quantization: weights or activations?
4. What's the typical quality cost of going FP16 → FP8 weights?
5. If you quantize weights from FP16 to FP8 on a memory-bound kernel, what's the rough speedup ceiling?

### Readiness Check

Not gated; the score nudges you to re-read or to ask OxTutor before continuing.

## Part 2 — Core Concepts — The Precision Ladder · 20 min
### Reading — The Numerical Precision Spectrum

Quantization is the *single biggest lever* for decode latency. Halving the bits roughly halves the HBM traffic — and decode is memory-bound, so that roughly halves the time per token.

| Precision | Bytes | Dynamic Range | Notes |
|-----------|-------|---------------|-------|
| FP32 | 4 | Huge | Training default |
| FP16 / BF16 | 2 | Wide (BF16 wider) | Standard inference baseline |
| FP8 (E4M3 / E5M2) | 1 | Medium | Hopper+ Tensor Cores native |
| INT8 | 1 | Symmetric ±127 | Mature, lossless-ish for many models |
| FP4 / NF4 | 0.5 | Small | Aggressive but works for many weights |
| INT4 | 0.5 | Symmetric ±7 | Heavy quantization, often with group scale |

### Why Quantization Works

**Compute-bound (Prefill):** Lower precision = 2× FLOPS on Tensor Cores (H100 FP8 = ~2× FP16 throughput)

**Memory-bound (Decode):** Half as many bytes per value = effectively 2× memory bandwidth

> **Empirically, dropping one precision level gives ~30-50% better LLM performance** (overhead eats some of the theoretical 2×).

### Source Material Reference

From **Inference Engineering Study Guide §5.1**: "Quantization lowers the numeric precision of weights to access more compute and reduce memory traffic. Wins both bottlenecks: prefill (compute-bound) gets 2× FLOPS; decode (memory-bound) gets 2× effective bandwidth."

## Part 3 — Deep Dive — Float vs Int & Sensitivity Ladder · 20 min
### Float vs Int — Why Float Usually Wins

**Floating-point formats** have a sign bit, exponent, and mantissa — giving **dynamic range** to represent very large and very small values. **Integer formats** have no exponent — they represent uniformly spaced values.

> **Neural network activations are heavy-tailed** (outliers in every layer). Float handles outliers gracefully; int either clips them or wastes range.

| Format | Spacing | Handles Outliers? | Best For |
|--------|---------|-------------------|----------|
| FP8 | Logarithmic (wider near zero) | ✅ Yes | LLM inference (sweet spot) |
| INT8 | Uniform | ❌ No | Simple tasks, embeddings |

> **Rule of thumb:** At the same bit count, **FP8 > INT8** in quality for LLM weights, especially with outlier features.

### The Sensitivity Ladder (Least → Most Sensitive)

From **Inference Engineering Study Guide §5.1**:

1. **Weights** — *least sensitive*. Quantize aggressively (FP8, INT8, INT4) with small quality loss. Biggest decode win.
2. **KV cache** — FP8 KV is now common — halves cache size *and* halves the bandwidth to read it.
3. **Activations** — more sensitive; outliers can blow up. Usually FP8 OK with calibration.
4. **Attention output / softmax** — *most sensitive*; usually kept in higher precision. Errors accumulate over thousands of tokens.

> **Recommended starter:** FP8 weights, FP16 activations, FP8 KV cache — the modern Hopper sweet spot.

## Part 4 — Hands-On — Weight Memory Calculations · 20 min
### Exercise 1: Llama-3-8B Weight Memory (10 min)

Calculate weight memory for Llama-3-8B at different precisions:

| Precision | Bytes/Param | Total Memory | vs FP16 |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| FP16 | 2 | ? | 100% |
| FP8 | 1 | ? | ?% |
| INT4 | 0.5 | ? | ?% |

**Answers:**
- FP16: 8B × 2 = **16 GB**
- FP8: 8B × 1 = **8 GB** (50% of FP16)
- INT4: 8B × 0.5 = **4 GB** (25% of FP16)

### Exercise 2: Savings Visualization (10 min)

If you have an 80 GB H100:
- FP16 weights + KV headroom = ~64 GB for model, 16 GB for KV
- FP8 weights + FP8 KV = 8 GB + 8 GB = **16 GB total** for model+KV
- **That's 4× more headroom for batching!**

---

## Part 5 — Hands-On — Decode Latency at Different Precisions · 25 min
### Exercise: 70B Model Decode Time Floor (25 min)

**Given:**
- Llama-3-70B: 140 GB FP16 weights
- 8×H100 with NVLink (per-GPU shard = 17.5 GB)
- H100 bandwidth: 3.35 TB/s

**Question 1:** At FP16 (17.5 GB per GPU), what's the decode time floor per token?
- Time = weight_bytes / bandwidth
- 17.5 GB / 3.35 TB/s = 17.5 × 10⁹ / 3.35 × 10¹² s ≈ **5.2 ms/token**

**Question 2:** At FP8 (8.75 GB per GPU), what's the decode time floor?
- 8.75 GB / 3.35 TB/s ≈ **2.6 ms/token**

**Question 3:** What's the speedup?
- 5.2 / 2.6 ≈ **2× faster**

**Question 4:** Including H100's FP8 Tensor Core boost (~2× more FLOPS), what's the combined speedup?
- Memory: 2×
- Compute: 2×
- **Combined: ~4× decode throughput** (typical实测: 3-4×)

### Source Material Reference

From **Inference Engineering Study Guide §A.5**: "FP8 vs FP16 throughput on H100: ~4× decode throughput, with typical 0.1–0.3 point MMLU regression. This is why FP8 is the default for serious deployments in 2026."

---

## Part 6 — Hands-On — Combined Memory Budget · 20 min
### Exercise: Full System Memory Budget (20 min)

**Scenario:** 70B model on 8×H100 (80 GB each = 640 GB total)

**At FP8 weights + FP8 KV + FP8 activations:**

| Component | Calculation | Size |
|-----------|--------------|------|
| Weights (FP8) | 70B × 1 | 70 GB |
| KV cache (FP8, 8 users, 4K context) | 8 × 4K × 128 KB | 4 GB |
| Activations (FP8, estimate) | ~10 GB | 10 GB |
| **Total** | | **~84 GB** |

**Question:** At 640 GB across 8 GPUs, how many concurrent users can you support?

- Per-GPU: 640 / 8 = 80 GB
- After weights (70/8 = 8.75 GB): 80 - 8.75 = 71.25 GB per GPU for KV + activations
- At 0.5 GB per user: ~140 concurrent 4K-context users!

### When NOT to Quantize

Pair discussion (10 min):
- Small batch + abundant memory + quality-critical task
- Early-stage eval where you're still measuring quality
- Models with known quantization sensitivity (some architectures)

    "explain": "INT8 maps values to 256 fixed integer levels, which clips outlier values. FP8 (e.g., E4M3 format) has a floating-point exponent that better handles the wide range of weight magnitudes in transformer layers. This makes FP8 less lossy for LLMs, which have outlier-prone activations."

    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "The sensitivity ladder from least to most sensitive is approximately: weights < KV cache < activations. Weights are static and can be calibrated offline. Activations are computed dynamically per input and vary widely, making them hardest to quantize without accuracy loss."
  },
  {
    "stem": "Why does decode benefit more from weight quantization than prefill does?",
    "options": [
      "Decode uses different model layers than prefill",
      "Decode is memory-bound — quantization reduces bytes per weight, directly increasing effective bandwidth and TPS; prefill is compute-bound so bandwidth savings matter less",
      "Prefill is never run with quantized weights",
      "Quantization is only applied to the KV cache during decode"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "Decode's bottleneck is memory bandwidth (reading weights from HBM). Halving weight size (e.g., FP16 to INT8) roughly halves the bytes transferred and doubles effective bandwidth, directly increasing TPS. Prefill is compute-bound — bandwidth savings don't help as much."

    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "FP8 = 1 byte per parameter; FP16 = 2 bytes per parameter. FP8 gives a 2× memory reduction vs FP16, the same as INT8. INT4 gives 4× vs FP16 (0.5 bytes per param). The memory savings directly reduce KV cache and weight footprints."

      "Zero — FP8 is perfectly lossless for all models"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explain": "Well-calibrated FP8 quantization typically costs ~0.1–0.3 MMLU points compared to FP16 on modern LLMs. This is an excellent tradeoff: roughly 2× throughput improvement for less than 0.5% quality degradation. However, some models are more sensitive — always measure before deploying."

      "When running on H100s, which do not support INT4",

### The Key Insight

> **Quantization is the lossy-but-massive lever. It changes the numbers, so you measure quality. But the memory/compute savings are enormous: ~4× throughput on H100 at ~0.1-0.3 MMLU regression.**

### Connect Forward
