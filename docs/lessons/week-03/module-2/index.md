You should have already read: "KV cache explained" blog with diagrams — Pre-Lecture Reading **Reader 4** + Study Guide §A.2 (~20 min).

### Quick Self-Check

Answer these questions from memory:
1. What grows every time the model generates a token?
2. Where in the transformer is the KV cache used?
3. For a 70B model at 128K context, can the KV cache exceed the size of the model weights?

### Readiness Check

    ],
    "answer": 1,

    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "Yes! A 70B model (FP16) is ~140GB. At 128K context with GQA, the KV cache can be hundreds of GB. This is why long-context inference is memory-constrained — KV cache, not weights, becomes the bottleneck."

    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "Without KV cache, every decode step would recompute K and V for ALL previous tokens — O(n²) per token. With KV cache, you only compute K and V for the new token, then cache it. This is the key to efficient autoregressive generation."

## Part 2 — Core Concepts — Why KV Cache Exists · 20 min
### Reading — The Problem Without Cache

Without a cache, generating output token *t* would require re-running attention over *all t–1* previously seen tokens. That's O(t²) cumulative work for *t* output tokens.

### The Solution: KV Cache

The KV cache stores the **K** (keys) and **V** (values) tensors that each layer computed for every token already in the sequence. Generating token *t* only needs to:

1. **Compute** new K, V for the *one* new token
2. **Attend** over the *cached* K, V for all previous tokens

> **That turns decode into O(t) per token — and is the only reason single-user generation is feasible.**

### Why This Matters

Without KV cache:
- 4-token reply would need ~16 forward passes worth of compute
- With KV cache: only ~5 forward passes (1 prefill + 4 decode)

---

## Part 3 — Deep Dive — KV Cache Size Formula · 20 min
### Reading — The Math

For one token, one layer:

> **bytes = 2 × num_kv_heads × head_dim × bytes_per_element**

For the whole sequence:

> **KV bytes = 2 × L × num_kv_heads × head_dim × seq_len × bytes_per_element**

Where:
- L = number of layers
- 2 = for K and V
- seq_len = context length

### Worked Example — Llama-3.1-8B (FP16)

Llama-3.1-8B uses **GQA** with 8 KV heads, head_dim 128, 32 layers, 2 bytes (FP16):

| Calculation | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Per-token, per-layer | 2 × 8 × 128 × 2 = **4 KB** |
| Per-token, full model | 4 KB × 32 layers = **128 KB** |

### Context Size Comparison

| Context | KV Cache Size | Vs 16 GB Model Weights |
|---------|---------------|------------------------|
| 4K | 128 KB × 4096 = 512 MB | 3.1% |
| 32K | 128 KB × 32,768 = **4 GB** | 25% |
| 128K | 128 KB × 131,072 = **16 GB** | **100%** |

> **At 128K context with batch = 1, the KV cache is as big as the model itself.** With any meaningful batch, it dwarfs the model.

---

## Part 4 — Hands-On — Calculate KV Cache Size · 30 min
### Exercise 1: Llama-3.1-8B at Different Contexts (15 min)

Calculate KV cache size for Llama-3.1-8B at:
- 4K context
- 32K context  
- 128K context

Then calculate: At 80 GB H100, what's the max batch size at each context length (after subtracting 16 GB model weights)?

**Answers:**
- 4K: 512 MB → max batch ~80 (before weights)
- 32K: 4 GB → max batch ~19
- 128K: 16 GB → max batch ~4 (if just model + KV, no room for computation)

### Exercise 2: 70B Model (15 min)

Recalculate for a 70B model with:
- 64 KV heads
- head_dim 128
- 80 layers
- GQA

At 80 GB H100, what context length saturates a single H100?

---

## Part 5 — Hands-On — GQA Impact · 20 min
### Reading — Why MQA / GQA Exist

Multi-Query Attention and Grouped-Query Attention shrink the KV cache by reducing `num_kv_heads`.

Llama-3 uses GQA with 8 KV heads vs 32 query heads → **4× smaller KV cache** than full MHA.

### Exercise: Quantization Preview

If K and V are stored in FP8 (1 byte) instead of FP16 (2 bytes), redo the 128K calculation for 8B:

- Per-token: 2 × 8 × 128 × 1 = 2 KB
- Per-model: 2 KB × 32 = 64 KB
- At 128K: 64 KB × 131,072 = **8 GB**

**Question:** Does the cache now fit alongside the model?

**Answer:** Yes! 8 GB KV + 16 GB weights = 24 GB (leaves 56 GB for batching)

    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "Without KV caching, every decode step would recompute attention over all previous tokens — O(N) work per step, growing to O(N²) total. KV caching stores the key-value pairs computed in earlier steps, so each new decode step only processes the new token and reads from cache."

      "The logit vocabulary distribution"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "Each generated token appends a new K and V vector to every attention layer's cache. For a model with L layers and H hidden dimension, the cache grows by 2 × L × H bytes per new token. This is the source of the linear scaling that makes long contexts expensive."
  },

    "stem": "Which of the following correctly expresses the KV cache size formula?",

    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "KV cache = 2 (K + V) × num_layers × hidden_size × sequence_length × bytes_per_element. The factor of 2 is because both K and V are stored. This formula shows why both long sequences and deep models create large caches."

      "Long contexts increase the model weight size proportionally",

    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "KV cache scales linearly with sequence length. For an 8B model at 128K context, the KV cache can be 32+ GB — exceeding the 16 GB model weights and consuming nearly half the H100's 80 GB HBM. Less HBM for KV cache means smaller batch sizes and lower throughput."
  },
  {
    "stem": "What is the direct impact of a large KV cache on serving throughput?",
    "options": [
      "It increases TTFT because prefill must be redone for each new request",
      "It reduces the HBM available for batching — fewer concurrent requests fit in memory, reducing throughput",
      "It forces the model to use lower precision to compensate",
      "It reduces decode speed by increasing the L2 cache miss rate"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "HBM is finite (80 GB on H100). Large KV caches per request leave less room for additional concurrent requests (smaller batch size). Smaller batches mean lower GPU utilization and lower throughput. This is why KV cache management — PagedAttention, quantization, sliding windows — is critical."

    ],
    "answer": 1,

### The Key Insight

> **KV cache scales linearly with context, blows past model weights, eats HBM that batching needs.**

### Connect Forward

Tomorrow: how **FlashAttention** rearranges the attention math to use HBM less, and how **PagedAttention** treats KV cache like an OS paging system — both are direct attacks on today's problem.

### Pre-read for tomorrow (Day 13 · FlashAttention & PagedAttention)

- **Resource:** <a href="https://gordicaleksa.medium.com/eli5-flash-attention-5c44017022ad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aleksa Gordić — ELI5 FlashAttention</a> + <a href="https://blog.vllm.ai/2023/06/20/vllm.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vLLM — PagedAttention blog</a> (~20 min).
- **Reflection questions:**
  1. Why is naive attention slow? Think about memory reads.
  2. What does "lossless" mean about FlashAttention?
  3. What does **PagedAttention** borrow from operating-system design?
