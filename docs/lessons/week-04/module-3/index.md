    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "The draft must be small enough to decode much faster than the target. Its job is to keep the target model fed with work — generating drafts faster than the target can verify them. A 1B draft vs 70B target gives the needed speed gap."

## Part 2 — Core Concept — The Wasted-Compute Problem · 15 min
### Reading — Why This Matters

The most impactful "free" decode speedup of the last two years. Used in vLLM, TGI, TensorRT-LLM. **Bit-exact** with greedy decoding under speculative sampling — so quality is unchanged.

### The Wasted-Compute Observation

Decode reads all 16 GB of weights from HBM to produce **one token**, doing ~32 GFLOPs of work. The H100 can do **989 TFLOPs FP16** — so the Tensor Cores are **~99.99% idle** during the 4.8 ms read.

Idea: while the GPU reads weights anyway, can it produce **more than one token of useful work**?

### Key Terms to Understand

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Speculative decoding** | Technique where a smaller draft model proposes tokens, verified in parallel by the target model |
| **Draft model** | Smaller, faster model that proposes candidate tokens |
| **Target model** | The actual large model that verifies draft tokens |
| **Verification pass** | Target model checks all draft tokens in one forward pass |

## Part 3 — Core Concept — The Speculative Trick · 20 min
### Reading — How Speculative Decoding Works

1. A tiny **draft model** (e.g. 1B params, 30× smaller and faster) proposes the next **K tokens** sequentially. Cheap because it's tiny.
2. The **target model** (the real 70B) does **one forward pass over all K tokens at once** — like a mini-prefill.
3. For each draft token, target computes the probability it would have produced that token. Accept the longest prefix that matches.

### Example Walkthrough

- Draft proposes: "The cat sat on the"
- Target verifies all 5 tokens in ONE forward pass
- If target accepts "The cat sat", tokens 1-3 are kept, tokens 4-5 are rejected
- Next iteration: target continues from "on the"

### Why Draft Must Be Smaller

- Draft needs to be 10-30× faster than target
- If draft is too big, it becomes memory-bound too
- No benefit if draft compute ≈ target compute

---

## Part 4 — Deep Dive — Why It's Faster + Bit-Exactness · 15 min
### Reading — The Speedup Math

The target's single forward pass over K tokens has roughly the **same memory cost** as one decode step (it reads all weights once). But it produces up to K accepted tokens.

| K | If all accepted | If 60% acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (no spec) | 1 token / step | 1 token / step |
| 4 | 4 / step (4×) | ~2.4 / step (2.4×) |
| 8 | 8 / step (8×) | ~4 / step (4×) |

In practice: **2–3× end-to-end decode speedup** is the production norm for code-like or predictable text; less for surprising outputs.

### Bit-Exactness

Under **speculative sampling** (the rejection-sampling variant), the output distribution is **provably identical** to the target model decoding alone. No quality drop — it's a pure systems win.

### What Kills Speculative Decoding

- **Draft quality too low** → low acceptance rate, draft compute wasted
- **Draft too big** → draft itself becomes memory-bound, no compute savings
- **High-temperature / creative text** → less predictable, lower acceptance
- **Memory contention** — draft + target competing for HBM bandwidth

### Production Choices

- vLLM: optional draft model (`--speculative-model`)
- **EAGLE** / **Medusa**: instead of a separate draft model, train extra prediction heads on the target — even cheaper

---

## Part 5 — Hands-On — Calculations + Tradeoffs · 30 min
### Exercise 1: Verification Walkthrough (15 min)

On paper, walk through one verification step:
- Draft proposes: "the cat sat on"
- Target verifies, what's the output?

**Answer:** If target accepts "the cat sat", tokens 1-3 are kept, token 4 is rejected. Next iteration starts from "on".

### Exercise 2: Speedup Math (15 min)

If draft is 30× faster and acceptance rate is 0.7 at K=4:
- What's expected speedup over plain decode?

**General formula:** Speedup = draft_speed × (acceptance_rate × K + (1 - acceptance_rate))

**Calculate:**
- Draft speedup: 30×
- Accepted tokens: 0.7 × 4 = 2.8
- Rejected (redecode): 0.3 × 1 = 0.3
- Net: 2.8 + 0.3 = 3.1 tokens per step
- Speedup: 3.1× (vs 1× baseline) = ~3× overall

    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "The small, fast draft model speculatively generates K tokens. These K proposed tokens are then verified by the large target model in a single parallel forward pass — the same cost as generating one token. If accepted, you get K tokens for the price of one verification pass."

    "options": [
      "It re-runs the draft model on each proposal and compares outputs",

    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "The target model runs one forward pass over all K draft tokens simultaneously — this is the key insight. Each token is accepted or rejected based on a rejection sampling scheme that preserves the target model's output distribution. Accepted tokens are free; rejected tokens trigger a resample."
  },
  {
    "stem": "Why is speculative decoding output bit-exact with standard decode?",
    "options": [
      "Because the draft model is identical to the target model",
      "Because the acceptance/rejection mechanism mathematically preserves the target model's exact output distribution",

      "Because the draft tokens are always accepted without modification"
    ],
    "answer": 1,

    "options": [
      "The draft model using more memory than the target model",

      "Large batch sizes that eliminate the latency benefit"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "Speculative decoding speedup depends on the acceptance rate α. If α is high (draft and target agree), multiple tokens per step are accepted — large speedup. If α is low (draft model mismatch), the rejection overhead reduces or eliminates the speedup. Workload predictability (code, templates) gives high α; creative text gives low α."

      "Because the draft model can be run on the CPU, freeing GPU bandwidth"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "During decode with small batches, the GPU uses ~0.7% of its Tensor Cores (memory-bound, serial). Speculative decoding converts that idle GPU capacity into useful work (running the draft model or the parallel verification pass). It is 'free latency' only because those cycles would otherwise be wasted."

    "options": [
      "Speculative decoding requires no additional hardware",

      "Speculative decoding automatically disables itself for creative tasks",
      "All tokens are always accepted for predictable workloads"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "The key phrase is: 'Free latency, if the workload is predictable.' For structured outputs (code, JSON, templated text), the small draft model closely predicts the large model — high acceptance rate, large speedup. For open-ended creative generation, acceptance rates are lower and speedup shrinks. Always profile your workload."
