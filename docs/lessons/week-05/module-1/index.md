    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "TTFT measures the wall-clock time from when a request is received to when the first output token is generated. It's primarily driven by the prefill phase (processing the input prompt) and any queueing delay."

    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "TPS (Tokens Per Second) = 1000 / ITL_ms. For example, if ITL is 50ms per token, then TPS = 1000/50 = 20 tokens/second. This is the decode-phase throughput metric."

      "Batch size has no impact on latency"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explain": "There's a fundamental tradeoff: larger batches improve throughput (more tokens/second across all requests) but increase latency for individual requests (especially P99) because the system processes more requests in parallel."

### Reading

Every decision in Weeks 2–4 — TP size, engine, FP8 — is justified by *some* metric improving. If you measure the wrong number, or the wrong percentile, you ship the wrong system. This day is when "fast" stops being a feeling and becomes a number with a percentile attached.

### Reflection (write your answer)

Take 2 minutes to write down:
> What's the difference between "fast" as a feeling and "fast" as a number?

## Part 2 — Deep Dive — The Metric Vocabulary · 20 min
### Reading — Latency Metrics (Per Request)

| Metric | What it Measures | Driven By |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| **TTFT** (Time To First Token) | Wall-clock from request received → first output token | Prefill speed, queueing |
| **ITL** (Inter-Token Latency) | Time between consecutive output tokens | Decode speed |
| **TPS** (Tokens Per Second) | 1000 / ITL_ms | Decode speed |
| **End-to-end Latency** | Request received → response complete | TTFT + output_tokens × ITL |

### Reading — Throughput Metrics (Per System)

| Metric | What it Measures |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Requests Per Second** | Sustained request admission rate |
| **Tokens Per Second (aggregate)** | Across all concurrent requests |
| **Concurrency** | In-flight requests at peak |
| **GPU Utilization** | Tensor Core busy time fraction (compute) and HBM bandwidth fraction (memory) |

### Reading — Percentile Metrics

Mean latency hides outliers. Real reporting uses **percentiles**:

- **P50 (median)** — typical request.
- **P95** — 1 in 20 requests slower than this.
- **P99** — 1 in 100 requests slower. **Most user-experience SLOs are P99.**

> **Rule of thumb:** P99 / P50 ratio > 5× means you have a queueing or batching issue.

---

## Part 3 — Hands-On — Percentile Calculations · 25 min
### Exercise 1: Calculate Percentiles (15 min)

Given the following latency distribution (in milliseconds):
```
{50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 150, 5000}
```

**Calculate:**
1. **Mean** (arithmetic average)
2. **P50** (median)
3. **P95** (95th percentile)
4. **P99** (99th percentile)

**Write down:** What does the mean hide? What does P99 reveal that the mean doesn't?

### Exercise 2: Interpret the Distribution (10 min)

Look at the distribution above. The value `5000` ms (5 seconds) represents a cold start or a timeout.

- If you only report "mean latency," what does the user see?
- If you report "P99 latency," what does the user see?
- Why is P99 more relevant for user experience than mean?

---

## Part 4 — Hands-On — Latency vs Throughput Tradeoff · 25 min
### Exercise 1: Sketch the Frontier (15 min)

Draw a coordinate system with:
- **X-axis:** Throughput (tokens/sec)
- **Y-axis:** Latency (ms per request)

Sketch two curves:
1. **P50 Latency** curve — typically decreases slightly then increases as batch size grows
2. **P99 Latency** curve — stays low initially, then spikes dramatically at high load

**Mark the point** where the system transitions from "healthy" to "overloaded."

### Exercise 2: The Tradeoff Explained (10 min)

**Why does this tradeoff exist?**

| Batch Size | Effect on Latency | Effect on Throughput |
|------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Small (1-2) | Low (fast) | Low (under-utilized GPU) |
| Medium (8-16) | Moderate | High |
| Large (64+) | High (queueing + slower decode) | Very High (but P99 suffers) |

**Write one sentence** summarizing the latency-throughput tradeoff in your own words.

## Part 5 — Discussion — Goodhart Traps · 20 min
### Reading — Goodhart's Law

> *"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."*

If you bonus on "TPS averaged over the day" you'll see engineers slowly slip TTFT and never get called on it. Always report **a vector of metrics with percentiles**, not a single number.

### Exercise: Identify Goodhart Traps (Pair Drill) (15 min)

Pick two products from this list:
- ChatGPT (consumer chat)
- GitHub Copilot (code completion)
- A nightly research summarizer (batch job)
- An agent that does 30 tool calls per task (agentic)

For each product:
1. Name the **top-two metrics** you'd track
2. Identify **one Goodhart trap** — what could go wrong if you optimized only for that metric?

### Discussion Prompt (5 min)

**"GPU utilization is 95%."** Why is that not enough to know if your system is healthy?

Think about:
- What if 95% is spent waiting for KV cache, not computing?
- What if the requests are queuing up waiting for that 5% idle time?

---

## Part 7 — Wrap-up & Connection · 10 min
### What to Measure Per Workload

| Workload | Top-Priority Metric |
|----------|---------------------|
| Chat / Q&A (user waiting) | P99 TTFT + median TPS |
| Batch summarization | Aggregate TPS, cost / 1M tokens |
| Code completion | P99 TTFT (very tight, < 200 ms) |
| Document analysis (long output) | Median TPS, P95 end-to-end |
| Agentic tool calls (multi-turn) | P99 end-to-end per turn |

### Reflection Question

Create a table with:
- TTFT P99 target: ___
- TPS median target: ___
- Requests/sec: ___
- GPU utilization target: ___

    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "TTFT = time from request receipt to first token emitted. It is driven by the prefill phase (processing all input tokens). TTFT is the primary latency metric for interactive use cases where users perceive responsiveness from when streaming starts."
  },
  {
    "stem": "For code completion (e.g., GitHub Copilot-style), what is the top-priority latency metric and why?",
    "options": [
      "Aggregate TPS — because code generation needs to be fast overall",
      "P99 TTFT with a very tight target (< 200 ms) — because users expect instant inline completions and any delay breaks the typing flow",
      "Cost per million tokens — because code assistants are used frequently",
      "GPU utilization — because maximum hardware usage minimizes per-user cost"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "Code completion has the tightest TTFT requirement of any workload — the IDE must respond before the user's next keystroke. The lesson's table shows: 'Code completion: P99 TTFT (very tight, < 200 ms).' Even TPS matters less if the first suggestion appears slowly."
  },
  {
    "stem": "What does P99 TTFT mean?",
    "options": [
      "The average TTFT across 99 requests",
      "The TTFT at the 99th percentile — 99% of requests have lower TTFT, only 1% are slower",

      "The TTFT target that 99% of the engineering team agreed to"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "Pxx percentile means X% of requests complete at or below this value. P99 TTFT = only 1% of requests have higher TTFT. P99 is used instead of average because it captures tail latency — the slow outliers that users actually experience as frustrating, even if the average is good."

    "options": [
      "P99 TTFT — because documents must start processing quickly",
      "Aggregate throughput (TPS) and cost per million tokens — because the workload is not user-facing and maximizing throughput minimizes cost",
      "GPU utilization — because batch jobs must run at 100% GPU usage",
      "Median TTFT — because individual document latency matters"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "Batch summarization is not interactive — no user waits for individual responses. The goal is to process the largest volume of documents at the lowest cost. The lesson states: 'Batch summarization: Aggregate TPS, cost / 1M tokens.'"
  },
  {
    "stem": "Why is GPU utilization important as a cost metric?",
    "options": [
      "Higher GPU utilization always means lower latency",
      "GPU cost is roughly fixed per hour — higher utilization means more tokens generated per dollar of GPU time",
      "GPU utilization determines whether the model runs in FP16 or FP8",
      "Low GPU utilization triggers autoscaling which increases costs"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "You pay for GPU time regardless of whether the GPU is busy (e.g., $24/hour for an 8×H100 box). If GPU utilization is 20%, you're generating tokens at 20% of capacity — cost per token is 5× higher than at full utilization. Maximizing GPU utilization is the same as minimizing cost per token."
  },
  {
    "stem": "What is the top-priority metric for an agentic tool-calling workload with multiple back-and-forth turns?",
    "options": [
      "Aggregate TPS — because agents make many small calls",
      "P99 TTFT per turn — because agent tools block on each LLM call and latency accumulates across turns",
      "P99 end-to-end per turn — because the user only cares about each turn completing, not the first token",
      "GPU utilization — because agents have low concurrency so the GPU may be idle"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explain": "The lesson states: 'Agentic tool calls (multi-turn): P99 end-to-end per turn.' Agents run sequentially — each turn must finish before the next tool call starts. End-to-end latency per turn (including both prefill and decode) determines how quickly the agent chain completes."
