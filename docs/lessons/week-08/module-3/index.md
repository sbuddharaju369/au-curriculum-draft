## Part 2 — Core Concepts: Streaming Architecture · 25min

### Reading —

**`capsule stream <config-tag>`** opens a hardware-encoded WebRTC stream of the remote machine's desktop (full desktop by default; single app with `--app <name>`).

**Hardware encoding pipeline:**

```
Remote GPU → Hardware Encoder → Encoded frames
                                      ↓
                              WebRTC transport
                                      ↓
                            Client browser / viewer
                                      ↓
                              Hardware Decoder (client GPU)
```

Hardware encoders:

| Encoder | GPU requirement | OS |
|---|---|---|
| NVENC | NVIDIA GPU (any modern) | Linux, Windows |
| VAAPI | Intel or AMD GPU | Linux only |
| VideoToolbox | Apple Silicon (M1+) | macOS only |

The GPU does all encoding work — **negligible performance impact** on running workloads. Even with a stream open at 1080p/60fps, a training job on the same GPU loses < 1% throughput (encoder uses dedicated silicon, separate from compute cores).

**WebRTC transport:**

Same channel as SshRTC but for video frames. Peer-to-peer by default (best latency). Falls back to TURN relay if direct peer-to-peer is blocked (corporate firewall, symmetric NAT). You can force TURN with `--turn` for testing.

**`capsule docker <config-tag>` — companion command:**

Launches an Ubuntu container on the remote machine, drops you into a shell. By default, the container has no GPU access:

```bash
capsule docker <config-tag>           # → container, no GPU
nvidia-smi                             # → Error: no NVIDIA devices found

capsule docker <config-tag> -- --gpus all   # → container with GPU
nvidia-smi                             # → shows GPU info
```

The `-- --gpus all` passes Docker flags through the Capsule CLI to the container runtime.

### Exercise:

1. Why is NVENC hardware encoding on the GPU preferred over software encoding (CPU)?
2. A user reports that streaming uses too much of the GPU. How would you verify whether this is actually the encoder or a workload issue?
3. When does WebRTC fall back to TURN relay? What is the tradeoff (latency vs connectivity)?
4. Run `capsule docker <config-tag>` on a machine you have access to. Confirm you can reach the shell. Then exit and re-launch with `-- --gpus all`. What does `nvidia-smi` show?

## Part 3 — Core Concepts: When to Stream vs Term/Exec · 20min

### Reading —

**Decision table:**

| Use `capsule stream` | Use `capsule term` / `capsule exec` |
|---|---|
| GUI application (ComfyUI, Blender, browser-based debugger) | CLI command or script |
| Visual output (rendered images, model outputs in a GUI app) | Log collection / monitoring |
| Clipboard-heavy workflow (copy between remote and local) | File transfer |
| Debugging front-end / rendering on remote GPU | Running benchmarks |
| Interactive desktop app configuration | Unattended batch jobs |

**The key question:** *Does the task require a human to see and interact with a GUI?*

- Yes → stream
- No → term or exec

**Cost of streaming:**

Streaming keeps a persistent video channel open. This costs:
- ~5–15 Mbps downlink bandwidth (1080p/30fps, variable by content)
- Latency adds: ~20–50ms for local network; ~100–200ms if TURN relay

**Clipboard sync:**

`capsule stream` includes bidirectional clipboard sync by default. Text copied in a local terminal is pasteable on the remote desktop, and vice versa. This is often the main reason to use streaming even for apps that could run headless — the clipboard workflow is faster than `capsule scp` for small snippets.

### Exercise:

For each task, choose `stream` or `term/exec` and write one-sentence justification:

1. Run a PyTorch training script overnight and collect the loss curve.
2. Use ComfyUI to test a new ControlNet model with visual feedback.
3. Check whether a CUDA kernel is producing NaN values by inserting print statements.
4. Debug a React frontend rendering artifact that only appears on the GPU machine.
5. Copy a Jupyter notebook's output image to your local clipboard.

## Part 4 — Hands-On: Launch Desktop Stream · 25min

### Exercise:

Work through the desktop streaming flow end-to-end.

**Step 1 — Open a full desktop stream (5 min):**

```bash
capsule stream <your-config-tag>
```

Verify the desktop loads. Note the GPU listed in the stream quality overlay (if shown).

**Step 2 — Test clipboard sync (5 min):**

1. In a local terminal, copy a short text string.
2. Paste it on the remote desktop (right-click → paste, or Ctrl+V).
3. On the remote desktop, copy a different string.
4. Paste it in your local terminal. Confirm bidirectional sync works.

**Step 3 — Single-app stream (5 min):**

1. Stop the full desktop stream.
2. Launch with an installed application: `capsule stream <config-tag> --app firefox` (or another installed app on your machine).
3. Verify the app opens in the stream window.

**Step 4 — Comparison test (10 min):**

1. Stop the stream.
2. Open the same application via `capsule term`: SSH in, launch the app from the command line.
3. For your specific use case, which approach felt faster and more natural? Write one sentence comparing the two.

## Part 5 — Hands-On: App Streaming & Containers · 25min

### Exercise:

**Part A — Container GPU access (12 min):**

1. `capsule docker <config-tag>` — enter an Ubuntu container. Run `nvidia-smi`. Record the output (should fail or show no devices).
2. Exit. Re-launch with `-- --gpus all`. Run `nvidia-smi` again. Record the output (should show GPU).
3. Confirm GPU access with a minimal PyTorch check:

```python
python3 -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available(), torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))"
```

4. What would you change if you needed a specific Docker image instead of the default Ubuntu? (Hint: `--image` flag.)

**Part B — Port forwarding alternative to streaming (13 min):**

For web-based tools (JupyterLab, ComfyUI, Gradio), you can often use `capsule term` with port forwarding instead of full streaming:

1. On the remote machine (via `capsule term`), start a simple HTTP server: `python3 -m http.server 8080`
2. In a second local terminal, set up port forwarding: `capsule port-forward <config-tag> 8080:localhost:8080`
3. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your local browser. Confirm it shows the remote machine's directory listing.
4. Stop the port forward and the server.
5. For this use case (a web UI), which is better — `capsule stream` or port forwarding? Why?

## Part 6 — Core Concepts: Network Sensitivity & Failure Modes · 20min

### Reading —

WebRTC streaming is bandwidth-sensitive. Know the failure modes before users report them.

| Symptom | Most likely cause | Diagnostic step | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| Video stutters / drops frames | Insufficient downlink bandwidth | Run a local speed test | Reduce stream quality or move to wired network |
| Input lag > 200ms | TURN relay is active (latency to relay) | `capsule stream --no-turn` — does lag drop? | Check if direct P2P is possible; contact IT to unblock |
| Stream freezes, requires reconnect | Idle timeout or network hiccup | Check `--idle-timeout` setting | Add `--idle-timeout 30m`; reconnect manually |
| GPU shows 90%+ in `nvidia-smi` during what should be idle | Normal for active stream + no workload | Confirm with `nvidia-smi dmon -s u` | This is expected; launch a real workload |
| Stream opens but shows black screen | Display compositor not running on remote | SSH in; check if X server / Wayland is running | `systemctl status display-manager` on remote |

**Reliability rule:** When users report "input lag," always run a local speed test first before assuming the encoder or relay is at fault. 80% of "streaming is slow" reports are actually a local network problem, not a Capsule problem.

**Bandwidth requirements (approximate):**

| Quality | Resolution | FPS | Downlink needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Low | 720p | 30 | ~5 Mbps |
| Medium | 1080p | 30 | ~10 Mbps |
| High | 1080p | 60 | ~15–20 Mbps |
| Ultra | 1440p | 60 | ~25–30 Mbps |

### Exercise:

1. You receive a ticket: "streaming is choppy and video freezes every 10 seconds." Walk through the diagnostic steps in order. What is your first diagnostic command?
2. A user says "input lag makes streaming unusable." You check: P2P is working (no TURN relay). What do you check next?
3. Why does `nvidia-smi` showing 90% GPU utilization during an "idle" stream not necessarily mean the encoder is hurting your training job?

### Connect Forward

Streaming is the gateway to interactive GPU workloads. When you run benchmarks next week (Day 42) or monitor training runs, you'll often have a stream open alongside a terminal — the combination of visual feedback + CLI control is the daily workflow.
