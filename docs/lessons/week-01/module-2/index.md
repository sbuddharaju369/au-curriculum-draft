    "answer": 3,
    "explain": "<code>grep python</code> selects only lines containing the string <code>python</code>. <code>ps aux</code> generates all process data; <code>awk '{print $2}'</code> extracts a column from the filtered output. The pipe operator routes data but performs no filtering. The MIT Missing Semester Shell chapter covers <code>grep</code> as a filtering tool."

    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explain": "The Unix \u201cdo one thing well\u201d principle means <code>ls</code>, <code>grep</code>, <code>awk</code>, and <code>wc</code> each solve a narrow problem and compose on demand via pipes. Large monolithic programs tie logic together, requiring rewrites for new task combinations. The MIT Missing Semester Shell chapter motivates this with its pipeline examples."
  },

    "stem": "A student types <code>cd Documents/project</code> and gets \u201cNo such file or directory.\u201d Which two causes are most likely?",
    "options": [
      "The <code>cd</code> command requires an absolute path starting with <code>/</code>",
      "The path is relative and <code>Documents</code> does not exist in the current directory, or the name has different capitalisation",
      "The user lacks read permission on the home directory",
      "The terminal session has not been restarted since the directory was created"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "Relative paths resolve from <code>$PWD</code>. If you are not in the directory containing <code>Documents</code>, the path fails. Linux filesystems are case-sensitive, so <code>documents</code> and <code>Documents</code> are distinct entries. A permission error produces a different message. The MIT Missing Semester Shell chapter discusses relative vs absolute paths."
  },
  {
    "stem": "Why is the shell still the primary interface for engineers, even though graphical tools exist?",
    "options": [
      "Shell commands execute faster because the kernel gives them higher scheduling priority",

      "GUIs cannot display text output from tools like <code>nvidia-smi</code>",
      "Company IT policies generally prohibit GUI tools on production servers"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "Automation, reproducibility, and remote access are the decisive advantages. The same commands run unchanged on a laptop, a CI server, or a GPU node accessed over SSH. GUIs can display text; there is no kernel scheduling difference. The MIT Missing Semester Shell chapter opens with this motivation."
  },
  {
    "stem": "Compare <code>cat file.txt | grep pattern</code> and <code>grep pattern file.txt</code>. Which is generally preferred and why?",
    "options": [
      "<code>cat file.txt | grep pattern</code> \u2014 the pipe form is more readable",
      "<code>grep pattern file.txt</code> \u2014 it avoids a needless <code>cat</code> process",
      "Both are identical in every respect including process overhead",
      "<code>cat file.txt | grep pattern</code> \u2014 <code>grep</code> cannot accept filenames in all shells"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "Using <code>cat</code> solely to feed a file into another command is called a \u201cuseless use of cat.\u201d <code>grep</code> accepts a filename argument directly, avoiding the extra process fork. The MIT Missing Semester Shell chapter demonstrates direct file arguments as the idiomatic form."
  },
  {
    "stem": "What is the practical difference between a relative path and an absolute path?",
    "options": [
      "Absolute paths are faster because the kernel skips a <code>pwd</code> lookup",
      "Relative paths work only inside the home directory; absolute paths work everywhere",
      "Relative paths can contain <code>..</code> but absolute paths cannot",
      "A relative path resolves from the current working directory; an absolute path always resolves from the filesystem root <code>/</code>"
    ],
    "answer": 3,
    "explain": "An absolute path like <code>/home/shiva/data</code> is unambiguous wherever you are. A relative path like <code>data/</code> means different things depending on <code>$PWD</code>. Both forms can use <code>..</code>; there is no kernel speed difference. The MIT Missing Semester Shell chapter explains this in its navigation section."
  },
  {
    "stem": "Why does <code>source script.sh</code> behave differently from <code>./script.sh</code>?",
    "options": [
      "<code>source</code> runs the script in the current shell process, so variable assignments and directory changes persist; <code>./</code> spawns a child process whose environment is discarded on exit",
      "<code>source</code> requires the execute bit set; <code>./</code> does not",
      "<code>./</code> executes the script as root; <code>source</code> runs it as the current user",
      "<code>source</code> works only with Python scripts; <code>./</code> works with any executable"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "<code>source</code> (or <code>.</code>) evaluates the script in the calling shell\u2019s environment \u2014 variable assignments and <code>cd</code> calls take effect immediately. A subprocess from <code>./</code> has its own environment that is discarded on exit. This is why shell setup scripts must be sourced. The MIT Missing Semester Shell chapter covers environment variables and sub-processes."

      "Performs command substitution \u2014 runs the enclosed command and substitutes its stdout into the surrounding expression",
      "Creates a subshell that inherits but cannot modify the parent\u2019s variables"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explain": "<code>$()</code> triggers command substitution: the shell executes the inner command and replaces the expression with its stdout. In <code>today=$(date +%F)</code>, the current date (e.g., <code>2026-06-24</code>) is captured and assigned. The MIT Missing Semester Shell chapter covers this syntax for using command output in variable assignments."

      "<code>cat notes.txt</code>",
      "<code>echo notes.txt</code>"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explain": "<code>cat</code> concatenates and prints file contents to stdout without opening an editor. <code>vim</code> opens an interactive editor; <code>touch</code> updates the file\u2019s timestamp (or creates it if absent); <code>echo notes.txt</code> prints the literal string <code>notes.txt</code>, not the file\u2019s contents. The MIT Missing Semester Shell chapter introduces <code>cat</code> as a basic file-viewing tool."

## Part 2 — Core Concepts Deep Dive · 20 min
### Reading — Shell Building Blocks

The shell is the interface between you and every system you'll touch this program: your laptop, the Capsule machines you connect to, the CI pipelines you'll trigger, the benchmarks you'll run. If you're slow in the shell, you're slow at everything.

### Core Concepts Table

| Concept | One-line definition | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `cd`, `pwd`, `ls` | Navigate the filesystem | `cd ~/Documents && ls -la` |
| Pipes `\|` | Send the output of one command into another | `ls \| wc -l` (count files) |
| Redirects `>`, `>>`, `<` | Send output to a file, append, or read from a file | `nvidia-smi > gpu.log` |
| `grep` | Filter lines matching a pattern | `ps aux \| grep python` |
| `awk` | Extract / process columns | `ls -la \| awk '{print $9}'` |
| `find` | Locate files by name / type / age | `find . -name "*.md" -mtime -1` |
| Globbing `*`, `?`, `[abc]` | Pattern-match filenames | `rm *.tmp` |
| Variables & `$()` | Capture values; run a command and use its output | `today=$(date +%F); echo $today` |
| Loops | Repeat over a list | `for f in *.csv; do wc -l "$f"; done` |
| Permissions `chmod` | Make a script executable | `chmod +x my_script.sh` |

### Worked Example — Extract GPU 0 Utilization

This is a real-world example you'll use in Week 9 when benchmarking:

```bash
nvidia-smi --query-gpu=index,utilization.gpu --format=csv,noheader,nounits \
  | grep "^0," \
  | awk -F',' '{print $2}'
```

**Breakdown:**
1. `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=index,utilization.gpu --format=csv,noheader,nounits` — queries GPU info in CSV format
2. `grep "^0,"` — filters to only lines starting with "0," (GPU 0)
3. `awk -F',' '{print $2}'` — splits by comma and prints the second field (utilization)

Each piece does one thing. Combined: a one-liner you'll use repeatedly in Week 9.

## Part 3 — Hands-On — Navigation Exercises · 20 min
### Exercise 1: Basic Navigation (10 min)

Practice these commands in order:

```bash
# 1. Go to your home directory
cd ~

# 2. Go to /tmp
cd /tmp

# 3. Go back to home
cd ~

# 4. List all files including hidden ones
ls -la

# 5. Go back to the previous directory
cd -
```

### Exercise 2: Directory Exploration (10 min)

Create this directory structure and navigate through it:

```bash
# Create practice directories
mkdir -p ~/practice/shell/{data,scripts,output}

# Navigate into each and create a marker file
cd ~/practice/shell/data && touch readme.txt
cd ../scripts && touch myscript.sh
cd ../output && touch results.log

# Verify with tree (or ls -R)
ls -R ~/practice/shell
```

---

## Part 4 — Hands-On — Data Processing · 30 min
### Exercise 1: Pipes and Filters (10 min)

```bash
# Count files in current directory
ls | wc -l

# List only directories
ls -la | grep "^d"

# List only Markdown files
ls | grep "\.md$"
```

### Exercise 2: Process GPU Output (20 min)

If you have `nvidia-smi` available, run:
```bash
nvidia-smi
```

Then parse it to extract:
1. All GPU indices
2. Memory used per GPU
3. GPU utilization per GPU

**Hint:** Use `--query-gpu` flag for structured output:
```bash
nvidia-smi --query-gpu=index,name,memory.used,memory.total,utilization.gpu --format=csv
```

If you don't have nvidia-smi, use this sample output:
```
0, Tesla H100, 16384 MiB, 81920 MiB, 45 %
1, Tesla H100, 32768 MiB, 81920 MiB, 78 %
2, Tesla H100, 16384 MiB, 81920 MiB, 32 %
```

Parse it to extract just the GPU index and utilization.

---

## Part 5 — Hands-On — Scripting · 30 min
### Exercise: Write disk_watch.sh (25 min)

Write a bash script `disk_watch.sh` that:
1. Prints disk usage of `/` every 10 seconds
2. Runs for one minute (6 iterations)
3. Uses `df`, a `for` loop, and `sleep`

**Starter code:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# disk_watch.sh - Monitor disk usage every 10 seconds

for i in {1..6}
do
    echo "=== Iteration $i ==="
    df -h /
    sleep 10
done
```

**Your task:** Add timestamps and make the output more informative.

### Make it Executable (5 min)

```bash
chmod +x disk_watch.sh
./disk_watch.sh
```

### Connect Forward

Tomorrow: git. Version control is how multiple humans collaborate on the same shell-driven world without overwriting each other.

### Pre-read for tomorrow (Day 3 · Git Workflow)

- **Resource:** <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlassian Git Tutorial — Basic Workflow</a> (~15 min).
- **Reflection questions:**
  1. What's the difference between `git commit` and `git push`?
  2. Why is "always work on a branch, never directly on main" a near-universal convention?
  3. Write a commit message in conventional-commit format for: "I added a new function that reads GPU temperature."
