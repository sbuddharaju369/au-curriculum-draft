# Day 28 · Tools & MCP

> **Concept of the day:** **tools** = functions the agent can call to act on the world. Each call has a **schema** the model must respect. **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is the emerging standard for exposing tools across model providers — write once, plug into any compatible agent.<br>

## Part 1 — Pre-Reading Review · 15 min

### Before You Start

You should have already read: AI Agents Student Guide **Module 2 — Action Layer** and the Anthropic MCP overview (~25 min).

### Quick Self-Check

Answer these questions from memory before continuing:

1. What is a **tool** in the context of an AI agent, and why does it need a schema?
2. What does **MCP** stand for, and what problem does it solve?
3. What's the difference between a **read** tool and a **write** tool?
4. Why must a write tool never be called "because the agent decided to"?

If you couldn't answer all four, re-read the Student Guide Module 2 before continuing.

## Part 2 — Core Concepts: Tool Anatomy · 25 min

### Reading — From ReAct Skeleton to Real Action

Yesterday's ReAct loop had a placeholder: `run_tool(action)`. Today you fill that in.

A **tool** is a function the agent runtime exposes to the model. The model does not run code directly — it **emits a structured tool-call**, the runtime validates it, runs the actual function, and feeds the result back as an `Observation`.

### Tool Anatomy

Every tool exposed to an agent carries six fields:

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `name` | Unique identifier — this is the exact string the model writes in `Action:` |
| `description` | One-paragraph explanation the model uses to *choose* this tool over alternatives |
| `parameters` | JSON Schema defining argument names, types, constraints |
| `returns` | Schema of the result fed back as `Observation:` |
| `side_effects` | `none` (read-only) vs `write` — gates safety policies |
| `cost` | (optional) token/dollar cost hint so the agent can prefer cheaper tools |

### Example Tool Schema

```json
{
  "name": "search_docs",
  "description": "Search the company knowledge base for documents matching a query. Returns top-5 results with title, snippet, and URL.",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "query": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Natural-language search query"
      },
      "limit": {
        "type": "integer",
        "default": 5,
        "minimum": 1,
        "maximum": 20
      }
    },
    "required": ["query"]
  },
  "returns": {
    "type": "array",
    "items": {"type": "object"}
  },
  "side_effects": "none"
}
```

### The Tool Dispatch Loop

The runtime — not the model — executes tools. The model only emits a structured request:

```python
while not done:
    response = llm.generate(messages, tools=TOOL_SCHEMAS)
    for tool_call in response.tool_calls:
        validate_against_schema(tool_call)   # types, required fields
        check_policy(tool_call)              # write tools: extra checks
        result = TOOLS[tool_call.name](**tool_call.args)
        messages.append({"role": "tool", "content": result})
    done = response.is_final()
```

Three critical steps before any execution: **validate → check policy → run**. Skip any one and you have a production bug.

### Why the Description Field Dominates

The model uses `description` — not `name` — to decide which tool to call. A vague or misleading description is the most common source of tool-selection errors. Rule of thumb: the description should answer "when would I pick this tool over the others?"

---

## Part 3 — Deep Dive: Read vs Write & Safety · 20 min

### Reading — The Most Important Distinction

Tools fall into two classes. This distinction controls almost every safety decision in agent design:

| Read Tools | Write Tools |
|---|---|
| `search_docs`, `get_weather`, `read_file`, `query_database` | `send_email`, `create_ticket`, `write_file`, `transfer_money`, `delete_record` |
| Safe to call freely | Need approval / dry-run / audit log / rate-limiting |
| Reversible — world is unchanged | Often irreversible — real effects in the real world |
| Pre-deployment testing easy | Must test in a sandbox first |
| Failure = bad observation | Failure = real-world harm |

> **Rule:** Write tools require a **human-in-the-loop confirmation** step, OR a **pre-validated allowlist**, OR a **sandboxed dry-run** — never "the agent decided to."

### Tool-Call Success Rate Compounds

This is the reliability math for tools:

- At **95% per-call** reliability, 10 tool calls in sequence → **0.95^10 ≈ 60%** end-to-end success.
- At **99% per-call** reliability, 10 tool calls → **0.99^10 ≈ 90%** end-to-end success.
- At **99.9% per-call**, 10 calls → **0.999^10 ≈ 99%**.

Each write tool in the chain multiplies the blast radius of any failure. Keep write-tool chains short.

### Tool-Count Degradation

More tools ≠ better. Model accuracy degrades noticeably when the tool list exceeds ~30 entries. The model spends too much attention on tool selection.

Solutions:
- **Tier tools**: load only tools relevant to the current task phase.
- **Tool-of-tools**: a meta-tool that dispatches to specialized sub-toolsets.
- **Semantic routing**: pick tools based on the task description before passing to the model.

## Part 4 — Core Concepts: MCP & A2A · 20 min

### Reading — Why MCP Exists

Pre-MCP, every model provider had its own tool-calling format:
- OpenAI: `functions` / `tools` JSON
- Anthropic: `tool_use` content blocks
- Local engines: ad-hoc formats

Build your tools for OpenAI agents, and porting to Claude meant rewriting the entire tool layer. **5 integrations × 2 engineer-weeks bespoke = 10 weeks of work.** With existing MCP servers: **~2 weeks**.

### What MCP Standardizes

**Model Context Protocol** (Anthropic-originated, November 2024, "the USB-C for AI") defines a server-client protocol:

- **MCP server** — exposes tools (and resources) via **stdio** or **HTTP/SSE**.
- **MCP client** — embedded in the agent runtime; discovers and calls server tools.
- **Transport** — **JSON-RPC** over the chosen channel.

A tool implemented as an MCP server is consumable by any MCP-aware host: Claude Desktop, Cursor, OxCode, Capsule deployments, and any future compatible agent.

### MCP Building Blocks

| Block | What It Is |
|---|---|
| **Tools** | Function calls with schemas — the most common block |
| **Resources** | Document-like objects the agent can read (e.g., files, DB rows) |
| **Prompts** | Server-provided prompt templates the agent can use |
| **Sampling** | Servers can request LLM completions from the host — the multi-agent enabler |

### A2A — Agent-to-Agent Protocol

**A2A** sits above MCP. Where MCP handles model ↔ tool communication, A2A handles **agent ↔ agent** communication — coordinating goals, passing sub-tasks, and receiving results between agents that may run on different runtimes.

```
User
  └──> Orchestrator Agent  (A2A: delegates sub-tasks)
         ├──> Search Agent      (MCP: uses search_docs tool)
         ├──> Writer Agent      (MCP: uses file_write tool)
         └──> Review Agent      (MCP: uses read_file tool)
```

By Week 9, your benchmark runner will use this pattern.

## Part 5 — Hands-On: Design Tool Schemas · 25 min

### Exercise: Write Three Tool Schemas

Pick **three functions** from any project you've worked on (or invent plausible ones). For each, write the full tool schema in JSON.

Requirements for each schema:
- `name` in snake_case
- `description` (1–2 sentences that answer "when would I pick this over the others?")
- `parameters` with at least 2 fields, one of which has a constraint (min/max, enum, or pattern)
- `side_effects` classified as `none` or `write`
- If `write`: write out the safety wrapper — what confirmation or policy check is required?

Use this template:

```json
{
  "name": "",
  "description": "",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {},
    "required": []
  },
  "returns": {},
  "side_effects": "none | write"
}
```

### Exercise: Classify & Design Safety Wrappers

Classify each tool as **read** or **write**, and for each write tool describe the safety wrapper:

| Tool | Read or Write? | Safety Wrapper (if write) |
|------|---------------|---------------------------|
| `query_database` | | |
| `delete_user` | | |
| `send_slack_message` | | |
| `get_user_profile` | | |
| `update_config` | | |
| `restart_service` | | |
| `summarize_thread` | | |
| `transfer_funds` | | |

### Exercise: Spot the Bug

This tool schema has at least two problems. Find and fix them:

```json
{
  "name": "do stuff",
  "description": "does things",
  "parameters": {
    "query": "string",
    "limit": "int"
  }
}
```

## Part 6 — Hands-On: Reliability Math · 25 min

### Reading — Compounding Over a Chain

Every tool call in a task chain multiplies the per-call reliability:

$$P(\text{all N calls succeed}) = r^N$$

where $r$ is per-call reliability and $N$ is the number of sequential calls.

### Exercise: Fill the Reliability Table

Complete this table (compute to one decimal place):

| Per-call reliability | N = 5 | N = 10 | N = 20 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 90% | ? | ? | ? |
| 95% | ? | ? | ? |
| 99% | ? | ? | ? |
| 99.9% | ? | ? | ? |

**Check your work:**
- 90%, N=10 → 34.9%
- 95%, N=10 → 59.9%
- 99%, N=10 → 90.4%
- 99.9%, N=10 → 99.0%

### Exercise: MCP vs Bespoke Cost

Your team needs to connect your agent to 5 external services (GitHub, Slack, Confluence, Jira, Google Calendar).

**Scenario A — Bespoke:** each integration takes 2 engineer-weeks.  
**Scenario B — MCP:** existing MCP servers exist for all 5; integration takes ~0.4 weeks each.

1. Total engineer-weeks for Scenario A: ___
2. Total engineer-weeks for Scenario B: ___
3. Time savings: ___
4. Name one downside of relying on existing MCP servers you didn't build yourself.

### Exercise: Tool-Count Threshold

You're designing an agent with 40 potential tools.

1. Why does providing all 40 tools at once degrade performance?
2. Sketch a tiering strategy: divide the 40 tools into 3 groups that get loaded at different task phases. Name the groups and give 2–3 example tools per group.
3. Describe the "tool-of-tools" pattern. When would you use it instead of tiering?

## Stuck?

Ask **oxtutor** — describe the tool schema problem you're working on, including the `name`, `description`, and `parameters` you've drafted, and ask for a review.
