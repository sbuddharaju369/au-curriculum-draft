    "explain": "ReAct (Reason + Act) is the simplest viable agent pattern. The agent: (1) reasons about the current state, (2) decides on an action, (3) acts, (4) observes the result, and (5) repeats until the goal is met. It's the core pattern behind most agent implementations."

    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "The agent loop is: Perceive (get input/observation) → Plan (decide what to do) → Act (take action) → Observe (see result) → Repeat (continue until goal is met). This is the fundamental cycle that makes agents different from stateless chatbots."

      "There is no difference"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "A chatbot is single-shot: one prompt in, one response out. An agent is in a loop — it can take multiple actions, observe results, and iterate until a goal is met. Agents have 'agency' — they can act on the world, not just respond."

    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "'Shaping' is structuring prompts to guide the agent toward desired behaviors. It's like 'herding' — you set up the right context, role, and examples so the agent naturally goes in the right direction, rather than using overly restrictive rules that might backfire."

    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "A 'wall' is a hard constraint that the agent must not violate — like 'never reveal API keys' or 'never provide medical advice'. These are placed in the system prompt to ensure the agent has clear boundaries on what it can and cannot do."

      "It makes the model more accurate"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "Faster decode (from Phase 1 optimizations like Tensor Parallelism, quantization, better engines) means the agent loop can run more iterations per second. Since agents make many sequential LLM calls, faster decode directly translates to faster agent task completion."

## Part 2 — Core Concepts: The Agent Loop · 20 min
### Reading — From Calculator to Strategist

Until roughly 2022, working with a language model meant one prompt in, one response out. The interaction was probabilistic, single-shot, and bounded by design: every request started fresh, and the model never acted on anything. Useful, but limited — a kind of fast, articulate calculator.

An AI agent is different in one crucial way: **it runs in a loop.**

### The Five-Step Loop

```
┌────────┐
│ Goal   │  (from user or upstream agent)
└───┬────┘
    ▼
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Perceive   — read inputs + state │
│ 2. Plan       — decide next action  │
│ 3. Act        — call a tool         │
│ 4. Observe    — read the result     │
│ 5. Reflect    — update state, check │
│                if goal achieved     │
└───┬────────────────────────────────┘
    │  loop until done or max steps
    ▼
┌────────┐
│ Result │
└────────┘
```

A bare LLM is **single-shot**: one input → one output. An agent is the loop.

### Assistant vs Agent

| Property | Assistant | Agent |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Calls per task | 1 | 5–50+ |
| State | Stateless (per turn) | Stateful loop |
| Tool use | Optional / single | Central / multiple |
| Failure mode | One bad answer | Compounding drift, infinite loops |
| Cost model | $ per query | $ per *task* |

---

## Part 3 — Deep Dive: ReAct Pattern · 20 min
### Reading — Reason + Act

The most common agent pattern is **ReAct** (Reason + Act). Each step the agent produces:

```
Thought: (reasoning about what to do next)
Action: tool_name(arguments)
Observation: (result of the tool call, fed back in)
```

This continues until the agent emits `Final Answer:` (or hits a step limit).

### Why ReAct Works

The **explicit reasoning** (`Thought:`) is just Chain-of-Thought (Day 28) applied between actions. The model writes its rationale, which becomes context for the next step.

> **Key insight:** The model doesn't just act — it thinks out loud about what it's going to do, then does it, then observes the result. That observation feeds back into the next round of thinking.

### ReAct Loop Pseudocode

```python
def react_loop(goal, max_steps=10):
    history = [f"Goal: {goal}"]
    for step in range(max_steps):
        out = llm(history + [REACT_TEMPLATE])
        if out.startswith("Final Answer:"):
            return out
        thought, action = parse(out)
        observation = run_tool(action)
        history.append(f"Thought: {thought}\nAction: {action}\nObservation: {observation}")
    return "FAIL: step limit reached"
```

That's it. Everything else in this module is decoration on this skeleton.

## Part 4 — The Phase-1 Connection · 15 min
### Reading — Why Agents Work NOW

The Social Capital primer identifies four capabilities that converged to make agents viable:

1. **Foundational models** — GPT-class, Claude, Gemini, open-weight Mixtral, DeepSeek — that can reason about complex problems.
2. **New architectures** — Sparse MoE, Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) — that make models cheaper and faster.
3. **Reasoning** — Chain-of-thought, inference-time reasoning models — that let models think before answering.
4. **Tool use** — ReAct, MCP, and other protocols — that let models act and observe.

### The Inference Engineering Connection

| Phase 1 Insight | Why it Enables Agents |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Decode is memory-bound | Per-step latency must be low — drives FP8 + speculative + small models |
| Continuous batching | Multi-step agents = bursty traffic; static batching would queue forever |
| KV-cache prefix sharing | Agent loops repeat 90% of the same system prompt — prefix caching is huge |
| Cost/token | Agents make 10–50 LLM calls per task; cost scales linearly with depth |
| MoE/smaller models | Cheaper per-step cost makes deeper loops affordable |

> *"MoE = cheaper, FlashAttention = faster — that's why agents work now."*

## Part 5 — Hands-On: Trace a ReAct Loop · 25 min
### Exercise: Trace a 3-Step ReAct Loop

On paper (or a whiteboard), trace a 3-step ReAct loop for:

> **Task:** "Find the current weather in Hyderabad and convert it to Fahrenheit if it's in Celsius."

For each step, fill in:

| Step | Thought | Action | Observation |
|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | | | |
| 2 | | | |
| 3 | | | |

**What to identify:**
- Which tools would be called?
- What data flows between steps?
- When does the loop terminate?

### Exercise: Identify Real Tasks

List 3 real tasks that **need** an agent (vs. an assistant). For each, sketch the loop:

1. Task: _______________
   - Steps needed: _______________
   - Why agent > assistant: _______________

2. Task: _______________
   - Steps needed: _______________
   - Why agent > assistant: _______________

3. Task: _______________
   - Steps needed: _______________
   - Why agent > assistant: _______________

## Part 6 — Hands-On: Chain-Reliability Math · 20 min
### Reading — Long-Horizon Drift

Every prompt in an agent loop must be **≥95% reliable**. At 5 steps × 0.90 = 59% success; at 5 steps × 0.95 = 77%; at 5 steps × 0.99 = 95%.

**Long-horizon drift** is just multiplicative unreliability over time.

### Exercise: Calculate Reliability

**Question 1:** At what per-step reliability does a 20-step loop succeed at least 80%?

```
Reliability needed: 0.80^(1/20) = ?
Answer: ~98.9% per step
```

**Question 2:** At what per-step reliability does a 20-step loop succeed at least 95%?

```
Reliability needed: 0.95^(1/20) = ?
Answer: ~99.7% per step
```

### Exercise: Cost Math

If each LLM call costs $0.005 and a task averages 15 steps:

1. What's the cost per task?
2. At 1000 tasks/day, what's the monthly cost?

    "explain": "ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) loops interleave: Thought (the model's internal reasoning about what to do), Action (the tool call or response to execute), and Observation (the result returned by the tool or environment). This pattern makes agent reasoning transparent and debuggable."

    "options": [
      "MoE reduces model size; FlashAttention reduces GPU count",

    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "Agent chains make many LLM calls (sometimes dozens per user request). MoE reduces cost per call (Phase 1 Week 4). FlashAttention handles the long contexts agents need (tool outputs + conversation history). Without both, the economics of multi-step agents at scale wouldn't work."

    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explain": "Plan = the model reasons about the current state and decides the next action (which tool, which arguments). Act = the model actually emits the action (a function call, a JSON tool invocation, or a final response). The ReAct loop makes this split explicit as Thought (Plan) and Action (Act)."

### Connect Forward

Tomorrow: **tools and MCP** — how the `Action:` step actually executes, and the protocol that's standardizing it across the industry.

### Pre-read for tomorrow (Day 28 · Tools & MCP)

- **Resource:** <a href="../../../readings/ai-agents/">AI Agents Pre-Lecture Reading — Tools & MCP section</a> (~30 min). Supplement: <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anthropic — Introducing the Model Context Protocol</a> (5 min).
- **Reflection questions:**
  1. What problem do **tools** solve that prompts alone can't?
  2. What is **MCP** (Model Context Protocol)? Why does it matter for interoperability?
  3. If you write a tool with side effects (sends an email, writes to a DB), what safety pattern must wrap it?
